Report=
The sound to play when a Prism Tower fires a support beam. In the original game, the support beams did not cause a firing sound to be played. Note that lots of Prism Towers firing support beams at once may result in an annoying repetition or loud volume, so you may want to limit the number of instances of the sound and/or use a quieter or more subtle sound. If no support weapon is specified then there is no firing sound for the support beam by default.
[PrismForwarding.SupportWeapon]?IsLaser= (boolean)
Specifies whether or not a laser beam should be drawn when supporting another tower. The other laser controls (LaserDuration, IsHouseColor, LaserInnerColor, LaserOuterColor, LaserOuterSpread and LaserThickness) are also respected. If no support weapon is specified then the traditional support laser will be drawn (IsLaser=yes, LaserDuration=[General]PrismSupportDuration, IsHouseColor=yes, LaserThickness=3).
[PrismForwarding.SupportWeapon]?IsElectricBolt= (boolean)
Specifies whether or not an electric bolt should be drawn when supporting another tower. The other electric bolt controls (IsAlternateColor, Bolt.Color1, Bolt.Color2 and Bolt.Color3) are also respected. If no support weapon is specified then no electric bolt will be drawn.
[PrismForwarding.SupportWeapon]?IsRadBeam= (boolean)
Specifies whether or not a rad beam should be drawn when supporting another tower. The other rad beam controls (Beam.Duration, Beam.IsHouseColor, Beam.Color and Beam.Amplitude) are also respected. If no support weapon is specified then no rad beam will be drawn.
No other properties of the support weapon are referenced at present, however this could be changed in the future.

Example support weapon:

[NewPrismSupportBeam]
Range=9 ;or 8 if you prefer the original
ROF=45
IsLaser=yes
IsHouseColor=yes
LaserDuration=15
LaserThickness=3
Support Beam FLH
The firing origing of the support beam can be set by using the FLH controls on the buliding’s art entry - AlternateFLH0 specifies the rookie support beam origin, AlternateFLH1 specifies the elite support beam origin. If either of these are set to 0,0,0 (the default FLH value) then they will fall back to using PrimaryFireFLH or ElitePrimaryFireFLH, as appropriate.

Prism Tower Limitations
Prism Towers should not be allowed to undeploy - undeploying a Prism Tower during a charge sequence can cause an Internal Error.

Special Note Regarding Prism Forwarding
A common error that was reported during testing was a tendency for Prism Towers to not auto-target and engage enemy units. The solution for this was to be sure that warhead and/or damage was defined. If this happens to you, be sure to check that your PF modification defines warhead values or damage values. (Bug #896095)
