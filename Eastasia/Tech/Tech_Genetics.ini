; In Asia, children are "produced" in tubes rather than born. They will have genetic modifications to make them stronger, faster and smarter than the rest of humanity, but because smart people have no children in industrialized society, the population is only maintained through these reproduction factories. Also, a virus will be released that will insert the DNA for increased intelligence (and also other improvements) into all of mankind, and a large portion of the population will be affected.
