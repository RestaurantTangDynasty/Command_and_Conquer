;*** Eastasia Light Infantry **************************************************
;******************************************************************************
; This derives from the Militant, and its adelphotaxa are the UN Light Infantry, Conscript, and "Rebel". 
; Its relationship with the UN Light Infantry is especially complicated: 
; Vietnam has a unique version of this. 
; Imperial uniform, kasa, puttees, boots. 
;
; Tattered Imperial Uniform
* Tattered Straw Hat
* Bolt-action rifle
* Rusty knife
* Yen
* Bullets
* Decomposed rations
* Water bottle
; This unit should have firearm and bayonet, and be able to switch between the two. 
; Bayonet is the usual close-combat weapon (like Commando's knife, Warrior's sword and Shinobi's blade), 
; it deals death damage to units without melee armor. 
; This unit should have "Horde Bonus", with a 
; For variant Vietnamese, "Horde Bonus" entails "Frenzied". 
; This makes them immune to suppression when in the presence of other units with the same horde type tag.

; 2016/6/25/20/57/43: 
; Askari mutated by Tiberium
; Found on the [Isla de los Muertos] map, these zombies are transformed [Japan]ese personnel 
; left on the islands since the Great Pacific War in the 1940's through 60's. 
; They wear outdated and often torn uniforms and are often largely decomposed to almost skeletal state. 
; Many are dormant or barely mobile, but will attack the player if he or she approaches their "corpses". 
; They are mostly found in the underground/bunker portion of the map. 
; As they are often located between other true skeletons, they are hard to spot and the player should be 
; weary of approaching corpses to loot in the underground rooms and corridors. 
; When killed, Infected Ashigaru carry an old rifle, a tattered uniform, a rusty knife, some ammunition and some money. 
; Most of their baggage is worthless and it is hard to kill them in a way that makes it possible to retrieve these items.
