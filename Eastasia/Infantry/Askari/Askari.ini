; 2016/6/25/20/57/43: 
; Askari mutated by Tiberium
; Found on the [Isla de los Muertos] map, these zombies are transformed [Japan]ese personnel 
; left on the islands since the Great Pacific War in the 1940's through 60's. 
; They wear outdated and often torn uniforms and are often largely decomposed to almost skeletal state. 
; Many are dormant or barely mobile, but will attack the player if he or she approaches their "corpses". 
; They are mostly found in the underground/bunker portion of the map. 
; As they are often located between other true skeletons, they are hard to spot and the player should be 
; weary of approaching corpses to loot in the underground rooms and corridors. 
; When killed, Infected Ashigaru carry an old rifle, a tattered uniform, a rusty knife, some ammunition and some money. 
; Most of their baggage is worthless and it is hard to kill them in a way that makes it possible to retrieve these items.
