;----- AttachEffect -----
; This is supposed to implement Law of Conservation of Ninjutsu. 
; We've not figured it out yet. - '20/6/27. 
; The problem is, each additional Ninja in the same area should reduce the HP (i.e. armor malus) for all Ninja in that area by just +1 to n (ninja count) in the formula HP/n. 
; However, what actually happens is that since we can't make the malus itself be modified by n, instead, we get all Ninja having their health penalized by each individual Ninja's AttachEffect.ArmorMult, multiplied by n. 
; This works fine when there are just two ninja in the area (n=2), because they each have their HP halved by the presence of the other. 
; However, once there are three ninja (n=3), what happens is not that the armor multiplier now becomes .3333[...], but instead, they are now all affected by two other ninja's full AE.ArmorMult. 
; The LoCoN thus progresses quadratically: say that AE.ArmorMult is .5, then each of them is halved again and becomes .25 instead of .333[...], and the discrepancy only increases as more ninjas congregate. 
; Of course, there is nothing in the LoCoN itself, escept the name, that says we _need_ the penalty to progress as HP/n, but it is something to keep in mind: 
; Ninjutsu is not actually conserved because it gets distributed onto more heads, but it is diminished to a greater extent by the presence of additional ninja than additional ninja add to it. 
; There are two other issues with the idea: 
; a) Ninjas are _also_ affected by their _own_ penalty (at all times, not just in crowds). This is a trivial issue to fix though: I think we can just double their HP to make up for it. 
; b) LoCoN would need to be implemented as a two-tier AE. Each Ninja has an AE, which has an animation, which has an AnimWeapon, which has a warhead, which inflicts an AE, which has AE.ArmorMult. 
; There is no way to modify the spread of said warhead with the size of the group. This means that there would always be a localized cap on the extent to which other ninjas in a crowd reduce the HP of others. 
; If a player amasses so many ninja that they form a "horde" that exceeds the size of the said warhead's spread, then each ninja will only be affected by his neighbours, and not the entire horde. 
; It also means that peripheral ninja would be less affected than those in "higher density" areas of the horde. 
; We also cannot simply increase the spread, because the problem would occur at any spread below map-wide. There is an argument to be made for making it map-wide, but that was not the original idea: 
; The original idea was that the penalty occurs when the player masses ninja in a single area, not simply by recruiting many of them. 
; The spread could also be increased to be so large as to reduce the number of situations in which congregations of ninja exceeding that area come up. 
; But the larger you make the area, the more you run the risk of having situations in which ninja are affected by other ninja which seem distant and not in the same area at all. 
; Maybe there is a golden mean for spread? 
; What _should_ be happening in a situation like this is that the area should expand to wherever there is a high density of ninja - so that a distant ninja, separated from the others by acres of empty land, is not affected. 
; But when that ninja is at the same distance, but "connected" through the presence of many ninja in the chora in between, then he should be affected. 
; However, there appears to be no way to implement this. 
; It seems that all of these issues would plague any implementation of Horde Bonus within the existing engine (plus extensions). - '22/03/19
