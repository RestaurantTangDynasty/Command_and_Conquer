; Heavy Infantry (Mechanized Infantry). Formerly Protector and generic "Heavy Infantry". The Asian "Heavy". 
; Like Samurai can switch between melee and ranged mode, this unit combines two light infantry weapons: (a better version of) small arms (minigun) and rockets. 
; The rockets are direct-attack though, so they fill a different role. 
; Possibly, they also can't engage air. 
; Thus, the Heavy Infantry only really bests the Light Infantry, but it's a toss-up between it and the Rocket Infantry, depending on the niche that needs to be filled. 
; Walker Army gets this as Veteran. 
; Cyborg Army instead gets the Cyborg (which is this unit - except as a Cyborg) - irrespective of cyborg upgrades to other, regular infantry. 
;	I don't quite like that idea, because that means relegating the cyborg upgrades to regular infantry to a different tier (or StolenTech from Cyborg Army). 
;	That, however, grates with the decision to make Automata infantry the AA StolenTech bonus for AA. 
;	The implication would be that, if you steal from regular AA, you end up with _completely_ automata infantry (superior), 
;	while when you steal from the Cyborg Army, whose units are _more_ automatized (being cyborgs), you only end up with regular infantry being cyborgs. 
;		I suppose we could switch the two around & make vanilla AA StolenTech grant cyborg infantry, while making Cyborg Army StolenTech grant automata infantry?
