
; The chinese copy of the widely-used soviet troop transport, the '''Flak Track''' is a vulnerable tin box of dubious combat value, but essential transport cability, having excellent speed and off-road maneuverability. It is armed with an out-dated [[wikipedia:QF 2 pounder naval gun|QF 2 pounder]] "pom-pom" anti-aircraft gun left over from World War II stocks. While mainly an anti-aircraft weapon, the gun can be depressed to fire upon ground targets. In a deviation from the original soviet design, Chinese divisions utilize incendiary shells for their elite Flak Track units, making them quite lethal against the crew of opposing aircraft, should the gun manage to break through the hull. These shells also make the unit useful against enemy infantry, or in building bombardment. As the Flak Track's hull is thin and the design not very sturdy, it cannot absorb alot of damage - Flak Tracks are best used attached to larger groups of armored units, or as fire support for the infantry, where stronger armor, or large numbers of cheap infantry, will absorb most of the incoming firepower.
