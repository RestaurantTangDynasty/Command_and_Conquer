; Asian Alliance Sentry Drone, also used by LEGION and MegaCorp. 
; This unit uses a shotgun against infantry and drones, and a markerlight against vehicles, aircraft (landed), and buildings. 
; It can deploy into a stationary form, in which it becomes cloaked and uses a chaingun and markerlight against any 
; target simultaneously. 
; In both forms, it has sensors. 
;
; With its missile upgrade, the Sentry Drone gains the capability to launch missiles at vehicles and buildings. 
; 
; This unit cannot use SimpleDeployer for its deploy, even though that would be perfect for what we want it to look like. 
; This is because it has both a Primary and Secondary weapon in its mobile form. 
; SimpleDeployer can only switch between Primary and Secondary weapon, but we want the stationary form to use a weapon 
; different from those used by the mobile form.
