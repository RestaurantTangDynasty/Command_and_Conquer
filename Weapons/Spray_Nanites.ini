;*** Nanite Dispersion *********************************************************
;*******************************************************************************
; Formery NanitesDispersion, but I realized it's functionally analogous to other "spray" weapons. 
; (There could even be a directed-spray version of this, but I don't think we have any unit to stick that on.) 
; The Nanite Missile has to carry both of these weapons to get different effects for enemies and allies. 
; Vehicles which carry nanites also have a narrow-area version of this when destroyed. 
; Advanced nanite vehicles may be able to actively turn a nanite aura on and off, though 
; in that case, we might want to make the options either "repairs nearby friendlies at expense of own HP", 
; or "repairs self at expense of HP of nearby units (enemies and allies)". 
; Or perhaps even a "dial" which can first repair at the expense of nearby enemies only, 
; but dialing the ability up will also damage nearby friendlies (raising the possible amount of self-heal to be generated).
