; Portable electric blue railgun. 
; Soviet AT Sniper Elites use this. Soviet Snipers promote from MN to Dragunov to AT Gun to gauss. 
; Asian Shikari starts out with a railgun and keeps getting promoted to better railguns. 
; Soviet Snipers have superior range with their weapons, and enter into the gauss line at that high range. 
; Meanwhile, Shikari have lower level shorter-range railguns, and eventually promote to the long-range one that the Soviet Sniper enters the gauss line at. 
; It is also used by Ghost Stalker. 
;
; DisguiseFakeBlinkTime does nothing for the Soviet Sniper, but for the Shikari, it will determine the duration during which the "dark rain" effect is suspended.
