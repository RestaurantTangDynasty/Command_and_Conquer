;*** Cannon, 120mm ************************************************************
;******************************************************************************
; Sorting out the damage values has been very tedious. 
; Original notes list: 120mm (TD), 120mm (APR) (TD), 120mm (TS), 120mm (RA), 120mm (RA2), 120mmE (RA2)
; 120mm (RA) is really a 120mmx. 
; We re-named 120mm (TS) as 110mm. 
; We're not too sure anymore whether TD contains any 120mm, other than that of the Mammoth Tank (which is 120mmx, though this works via unit settings in TD). 
; Although it would make sense for 90's Abrams Tank to have a 120mm cannon, sources consistently call it "105mm" (although it is also weaker than the 105mm of RA2...)
; "x" weapons generally deal the same *total* damage as their single-burst counterparts (i.e. half the damage per shot)... 
; Balance was more important than realism. 
; Also uncertain is the meaning of "APR".

; War-Miner HE gun
; Unused in vanilla RA2/YR, this is now used as the gun for the ISU-122 self-propelled gun, as the 120mm caliber is the closest to the 122mm caliber on the RL ISU-122. Used on upgraded Abrams Tank, but this is still subject to some controversy.

; This no longer dual-bursts - all the veterancy benefits of this weapon are now coming from using HESH over AP, giving more anti-structure/anti-infantry damage
