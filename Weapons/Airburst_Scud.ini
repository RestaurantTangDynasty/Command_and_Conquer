;*** Scud Airburst ************************************************************
;******************************************************************************
; There used to be two weapons: "ScudDummy" and "ScudCollision"/"ScudExplosion". 
; ScudDummy had a range (5) which determined the Scud's CEP. 
; ScudCollision/ScudExplosion was the weapon used when the Scud actually impacted. 
; There is also "ScudLauncher", which is the weapon used to launch the Scud from 
; the "Luna" launcher. 
;
; ScudCollion/ScudExplosion have now been disbanded. 
; Scud payload will be handled via the missile damage/warhead entries again. 
; (Either the V3 ones, or custom missile Missile.Damage/Missile.Warhead code 
; included in Ares.)
; We retain one weapon to be mounted on the Scud, which is the "V3Airburst" (ra2/yr, but unused), 
; now called ScudAirburst. 
; This is a weapon used via Missile.Weapon, or missile's Primary or Secondary weapon slot, 
; which causes the missile to airburst close to its target, and release cluster missiles. 
; Should the implementation of ScudCollision/ScudExplosion ever become desireable, 
; I have merged them into Explosives, and a weapon from the Explosives line 
; may be mounted on the Scud as payload.
