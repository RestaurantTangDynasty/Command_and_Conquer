; The Cattlepult. Launches a cow. 
; Originally devised for the IFV Cow combo (which cannot be achieved in vanilla, and has not been created), 
; it is now intended as an alt-fire for the Catapult. 
; It inflicts minor physical damage, plus splashing gore. 
; The Rookie version originally was envisioned to spawn poison gas, or inflict poison radial, but this is moved to the Elite version.
