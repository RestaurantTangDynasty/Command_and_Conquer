[TossMolotov_vt2]
Damage=56 ; The initial damage isn't that much (considering ROF), the ensuing flames do most of the damage.
ROF=400   ; Very high ROF, the unit is hit-and-run. The game might lag too if too many flames were on screen.
Range=4.5 ; Don't make it higher so anti-infantry units can target them better
Projectile=MolotovPR
Speed=1 ;5
Warhead=MolotovWH ; Used to create the flames around impact site
Lobber=yes
MinimumRange=2 ; So it doesn't look so odd when he throws a molotov right next to himself
