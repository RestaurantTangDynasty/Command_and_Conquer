; Tiberium flechette sniper
; This works pretty much like the Virus Gun, but fires a tiberium flechette via gas pressure. 
; Shots are supposed to cause Tiberium poisoning and Visceroid transmutation, if killing the target. 
; Because it is a sniper gun, treat it like you would any other sniper gun in terms of effectiveness vs infantry. 
; Additionally, because the flechette is Tiberium, make it somewhat more effective against vehicles than hollow-point and even regular bullets. 
; Formerly [AetheriteFletcherGun.Lv1].
