; Prototypical ChemBomb. 
; Formerly Drop_Bomb_Gas_Toxin.ini 
; Subsumes Throw_Barrel_Toxin. 
; Used by the Catapult alt-fire, Brute RNGs. 
; Also use this weapon as the explosion of the Toxin Barrel, Venom Wasp, Infested, and Toxin Blast Truck. 
; This is a two-step. This weapon deals the initial damage of being hit by the barrel. 
; This then invokes the toxin splash. 
; Use the toxin barrel as projectile on this weapon.

;----- Projection -----
Range				= 8; Was 1.5 in PoisonBombDrop. Setting it higher is needed to make Catapult and Brute Lobber work as intended, 
; and does not harm the weapon's functionality for those cases where it is a unit's death-explosion. 
; The only functionality harmed by it would be air-dropped ordnance (which would be dropped from much further away), 
; but this is currently not tied to any prospective or extant implementation, as the only case of air-dropped toxin ordnance 
; uses a paradropped unit with this weapon as its death-explosion, rather than using the weapon directly. 
; Another case of air-deployed toxin weapons has been implemented not by bombs, but by spraying it directly (using SprayToxin). 
; Finally, a still other case (the Venom Wasp) is by the use of rockets. 
; There thus should be no issue for now.
