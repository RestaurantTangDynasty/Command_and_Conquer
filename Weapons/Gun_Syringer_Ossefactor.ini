=====Serum 116=====
* Commercial name: Etropin
Apparently a stronger ''Serum 115'', which causes Symbiotes to loose the ability to keep both their energy and their body together, turning them into a "blob" of sprawling flesh, rapidly loosing energy. Propably one of the best anti-Symbiote chemicals so far.
