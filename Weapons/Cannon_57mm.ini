; Used by Salvaged Rhombos. 

57mm
Caliber of the cannons of the WWI-era German A7V. 

57HE
57mm variant with HE warhead for use on MK V.

75HE
Used on the Sherman. Same stat changes (as percentage, not absolute) as to the 120HE compared to 120mm apply here for conversion of stats from the 75mm. Warhead used is HE, not HowitzerWH, due to result of [[xxmm to xxHE Howitzer controversy]].

	[75HE]
	Damage=31	; changed from 35 via 88,888...%Dmg in mm to HE conversion scheme...
	ROF=31	; changed from 40 via 76,923...%ROF in mm to HE conversion scheme...
	Range=6
	Projectile=Cannon
	Speed=40
	Warhead=HE
	Anim=GUNFIRE
	Bright=yes

76HE
Used on upgunned Sherman / Sherman Firefly. Since usual formula of generating Damage stats etc for new mm-measured weapons (Formula was: (Dmg of original weapon/mm of original weapon)*mm of new weapon) isn't really perfect for generating the stats of new weapons, the 76HE may simply use the stats an elite 75HE would have - there seems to be a certain scheme of increasing a weapon's firepower to Elite status, which I must find out.

	[76HE]
	Damage=36	; +5
	ROF=31	; this was kept the same...
	Range=6
	Projectile=Cannon
	Speed=40
	Warhead=HE
	Anim=GUNFIRE
	Bright=yes

105HE
Weapon used on Sherman 105 and Sherman Dozer. Usual percentual stat changes apply when transferring stats from the 105mm to 105HE. Uses HowitzerWH.
Also used on basic Abrams Tank, but this is still subject to some controversy.
