; Used by Isonade Carrier. Has to be differentiated from the one used by the Aircraft Carrier, as the spawned units can't pass over ground obstacles like Hornets can. 
; When only terrestrial or naval targets are supposed to be attackable (because the launched unit can't travel or attack out of land or water), use NavalTargeting on the spawner itself.
