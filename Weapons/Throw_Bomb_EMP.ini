; EM Pulse Weapon
; EMP Bomb (from Bomber)
; Formerly EMPBombDrop. 
; Merged with EMWave (EMP Infantry deploy weapon). 
; Merged with EMPCannon_3 (TS' EMPulseWeapon). 
; Electric Pulse - Zeus/Thor/Perun mecha secondary
; EMPulseWeapon's Speed was 25, but I think this has no effect and is not needed, due to the arcing/lobber nature of the projectile, which overrides Speed at least in vanilla (though be wary of EXE hacks overriding this (which would be the adroit thing to do)).

ROF				= 10  ; was 1
Range				= 5; It doesn't need a Range to handle the SW. That's handled by SW.MaxRange, so this weapon can comfortably use the Range value suitable for a bomb-drop. Was 40. ; Was 30.

AreaFire			= yes

Lobber=yes; This affects the SW, but is ignored for aircraft weapons and DeployFire AreaFire weapons, so we can use it here.
