; This nuclear weapon is used in two places: 
; It is used by Nuke Trucks, and by the "Black Market Nuke", which is an upgrade of the generic ability to detonate your own buildings. 
; Black Market Nuke has to be purchased from the Market for each use and can be targeted at any building owned by the firing player. 
; When fired, it will detonate the target structure in the equivalent of the Semyorka's nuclear payload.
