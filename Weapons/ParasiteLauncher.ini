; Vermin gun inflicts a large burst of initial poison damage. 
; If it fails to kill its target, the target gains poison DoT, pain, and slowdown. 
; Splash damage around the target also inflict poison DoT, pain, and slowdown. 
; When a target dies to either the initial attack, or the DoT, it spawns two "vermins". 
; Vermins inflict the same effect on infantry they attack.
