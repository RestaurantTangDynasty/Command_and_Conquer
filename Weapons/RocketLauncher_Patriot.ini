PatriotLauncher
Sub-type of SAM launcher. Its only purpose, per design, is that it fires a projectile using the PATRIOT shp rather than the MISLSAM vxl as image. Other than that, let's say it is identical to the RA2 [RedEye2], thus, stats can be tweaked for the SAMLauncher, depending on which weapon the SAMLauncher will finally take the stats from (RA's RedEye, TS's RedEye2, RA2's RedEye2), so stats may well ultimately be quite different for the PatriotLauncher and SAMLauncher.
