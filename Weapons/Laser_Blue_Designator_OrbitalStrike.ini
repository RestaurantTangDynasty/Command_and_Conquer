You can make each indivual bomb more powerful than the last,or just change all of their damages to the same.30 damage is a weak damage amount and the explosions occur in different places,you may wish to increase the damage.

Also remember the building you wish this to be triggered by or effectively come from must have NukeSilo=yes.

Enjoy this.
