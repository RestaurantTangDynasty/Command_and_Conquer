; piercing projectile with poison
; A separate warhead is needed for weapons that pierce armor and have poison as an added effect. 
; Simply giving such a weapon's projectile a sub-weapon with the [Poison] warhead is not sufficient, because it will fail against targets with hazmat_* armor, and only the first-stage weapon's damage will be dealt. 
; This [Piercing_Poison] warhead will ignore hazmat_* armor and poison targets with that armor normally, but it will not work against targets ImmuneToPoison. 
; It should not be used on the weapon directly, since that would mean that hits themselves would not deal damage to ImmuneToPoison objects (worse even, a weapon using this warhead could not attack them). 
; Although that doesn't matter for the Syringe sniper, as the damage dealt is miniscule. 
; This means that the damage lost due
