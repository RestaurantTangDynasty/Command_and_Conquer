Range				= 8; Was 1.5 in PoisonBombDrop. Setting it higher is needed to make Catapult and Brute Lobber work as intended, 
; and does not harm the weapon's functionality for those cases where it is a unit's death-explosion. 
; The only functionality harmed by it would be air-dropped ordnance (which would be dropped from much further away), 
; but this is currently not tied to any prospective or extant implementation, as the only case of air-dropped toxin ordnance 
; uses a paradropped unit with this weapon as its death-explosion, rather than using the weapon directly. 
; Another case of air-deployed toxin weapons has been implemented not by bombs, but by spraying it directly (using SprayToxin). 
; Finally, a still other case (the Venom Wasp) is by the use of rockets. 
; There thus should be no issue for now.

; A separate warhead is needed for weapons that pierce armor and have poison as an added effect.

; This [Piercing_Poison] warhead will ignore hazmat_* armor and poison targets with that armor normally, but it will not work against targets ImmuneToPoison.
