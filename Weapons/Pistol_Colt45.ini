;******************************************************************************
; This is Tanya's pistols, but the damage had to be scaled down to 100 from RA2/YR's 125 on the basis of it being a dual wield of the Colt 45 above, which inflicts 50 damage. 
; There appears to be no reason why this weapon would inflict more damage than the Colt 45 per-shot. 
; For the Elite version, the damage was kept, under the presumption that Elite Tanya hits with greater skill. 
; On the other hand, Tanya is already an Elite unit, so it might be acceptable for her to inflict greater damage. 
; However, in RA, Tanya uses the Colt 45 above and there is no reason to think that she is any less elite in RA than in RA2/YR. 
; Like with machine guns, burst is already factored into the animations and the damage, so the damage here is 100, rather than 50 with a burst. 
; The weapon's Damage is then reduced according to Verses/Damage isomorphy, with the warhead now forwarding the damage bonus against infantry targets, rather than Damage being very high and the warhead affording a damage malus against non-infantry. 
; Though, in this case, since HP bullets are used, there is another damage bonus against infantry and a damage malus against anything else from the ammo type.
