; This is a tricky one. 
; It is aligned with GDI in the TD campaign. 
; It is a Nod hotbed in TS. 
; And history (and lefthand's loadscreen pack) dictate it to be Soviet aligned. 
; In current RL, it receives a lot of support from the US, but it has 
; a lot of historically Soviet _hardware_, and it does the bidding of the US 
; in terms of fighting Islamists, but that does not contravene Russian interests. 
; If push comes to shove, it's unclear where the allegiances lie. 
; In particular with regards to the at-this-point-ongoing Israeli conduct in Gaza. 
; But - like many states of the region - there is no overt support for Russia over 
; its ongoing activities in Ukraine, unlike with, say, Iran. 
; I think Saudi Arabia's alignment with the Allies is a useful analog here:

; "prevailing order", even if politically aligned with the Soviets. 
; (Cf. the state of Russia itself at the eve of RA2, and the _fact_ that the RA2

; This Egypt is already infiltrated by Nod agents that work with the local Soviet

; From this arises the possibility of a Nod-based country special. 
; This country special could be a Scud with a laser warhead. 
; Or a Scud with invisible missiles.
