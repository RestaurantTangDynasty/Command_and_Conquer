;******************************************************************************
; The Tank Destroyer, as its name tells, is a vehicle designed to engage and defeat enemy tanks. 
; To that end, it is designed around a powerful high-velocity cannon, housed in a casemate rather than a turret, 
; as it is expected that traverse will be of negligible importance in engaging large and relatively unmaneuverable targets, 
; such as heavy armor. To further its effectiveness, tank destroyer doctrine is to attempt to catch the enemy off guard, 
; scoring a – hopefully devastating – hit before the enemy has time to react or evade the vehicle's limited line of fire. 
; Therefore, Tank Destroyers are equipped for laying ambushes. The Tank destroyer's gun can pin enemy vehicles on a direct hit, 
; rendering them immobile for a brief moment. Tank destroyers are crewed by Guards. 
; While almost entirely useless against infantry and buildings, elite crews regularly have their vehicles upgraded with a light machine gun 
; to at least provide some self-defense against infantry assaults. They are also regularly equipped with EMP shells to disable enemy vehicles for awhile.
