; The European Garrison Infantry is intended for use as crews of defensive installations. 
; They are equipped to quickly dig in and fortify an area. When not deployed, the Garrison uses a grenade launcher with a wide-area fragmentation grenade 
; that can arc over walls and is effective against infantry. When ordered to deploy, the Garrison Infantry digs in with a MG3, 
; a machine gun with an incredible rate of fire, capable of holding back waves upon waves of enemy infantry. 
; Beware of pitting the Defender offensively, however!
