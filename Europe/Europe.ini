In the world of Continuum, the National Socialist party of Germany was never dominated by Hitler's personal views on several issues. Hence, the term never acquired the meaning it has in our world. Instead, the term '''National Socialism''', or '''Ethnic Socialism''', is a term used for a range of movements that champion the cause of a particular ethnic group within the framework of a socialist system – that is, state-ownership of the means of production. There are numerous „national socialisms“ in the world of Continuum – for example, Arab Socialism or German Socialism – and the Soviet Union is actively sponsoring such movements, in line with Stalin's saying that the nationalism of small nations is the response to chauvinism of the great powers. 

The National Socialist movements oppose the mainstream Socialism of internationalist tendencies and while it sees abolishment of private ownership of the means of production as a goal, 

The system called „National Socialism“ in our world would, in Continuum, be unknown in practice, but could be described theoretically as a variety of Fascism, applied social Darwinism and anti-Judaism. No system with all these aspects of our world's Hitlerism exists in Continuum.
