In the world of Continuum, the National Socialist party of Germany was never dominated by Hitler's personal views on several issues. Hence, the term never acquired the meaning it has in our world. Instead, the term '''National Socialism''', or '''Ethnic Socialism''', is a term used for a range of movements that champion the cause of a particular ethnic group within the framework of a socialist system – that is, state-ownership of the means of production. There are numerous „national socialisms“ in the world of Continuum – for example, Arab Socialism or German Socialism – and the Soviet Union is actively sponsoring such movements, in line with Stalin's saying that the nationalism of small nations is the response to chauvinism of the great powers. 

The National Socialist movements oppose the mainstream Socialism of internationalist tendencies and while it sees abolishment of private ownership of the means of production as a goal, 

The system called „National Socialism“ in our world would, in Continuum, be unknown in practice, but could be described theoretically as a variety of Fascism, applied social Darwinism and anti-Judaism. No system with all these aspects of our world's Hitlerism exists in Continuum.

Alternatively, they may of course simply be lifeforms that rose and fell between the creation of Arda and the coming of Sauron, but entirely of "native" origin. 

Werewolves?
In ''[[Red Alert 2: Third Power]]'', the namesake ''[[Third Power]]'', a faction modelled after Nazi Germany and associated ''Ghostapo'', ''Nazi Super Science'' and ''Stupid Jetpack Hitler'' concepts, has a partisan organization, inspired by the real-life [[wikipedia:Werwolf|''Werwolf'']] organization, except that it is actually consisting of sleeper werewolves. According to the ''May 2012 Revision'', these animalistic partisans serve as anti-infantry units and upgraded forms of the [[Attack Dog]]. Because of technical limitations, they do not actually shapeshift, but are in wolf form perpetually. While the Attack Dog's bite is instantly fatal to almost all infantry units, the Werewolf has something even more vicious in store; infantry units that they attack do not simply stay dead, but are raised soon after as another werewolf, mirroring the theme of a contagious bite. 

Supersoldier?
===Red Alert 2: Third Power===
In the canceled [[Red Alert 2: Third Power]], the Third Power has regular soldiers superior to the basic infantry of either of the other sides to a degree bordering on supersoldier-ism, [[Knight]]s in powered armor and even werewolves (the latter two being specialized infantry as all sides have, rather than superior as such. Yet, they are superior to the specialized infantry of the other sides in terms of physique). 

===Red Alert 2: New World Order===
* The Allies have the [[Commando]], which is, although superior to regular soldiers, still a baseline human in whom high natural aptitude was potentiated by years of excellent training, the Allies' most powerful move-and-fire automatic rifle, and lots of unique gadgets (designator, OTL beacon,...). 
* The Soviets have rudimentary cyborg soldiers, although whether these are superior to human soldiers, or simply a "proof of concept" useful in a few narrow tactical roles is uncertain. They also have human soldiers fused with tank hardware. And then there is the [[Psi Corps]], which are psionically gifted humans who use their ability to their advantage in battle. Unfortunately, psionic powers do not necessarily coincide with a combat-oriented physique and most of them are not highly-developed enough (or developed in the proper direction) to grant them adequate firepower or protection in battle, meaning psychics can effectively be fought by regular infantry and serves more of a specialist role, rather than being superior in the role of regulars. They ''are'' undoubtedly superior in many compartments to regular soldiers though. 
* The Third Power has various forms of modified humans that are superior to regular soldiers, such as the [[Flesh Golem]] and [[Werewolf]], and even the [[Storm Trooper]]. While 
* The Brotherhood has several mutants who bear a grudge against both the Allies and Soviets. A far cry from the X-Men (and several other named mutant chars in the game), they are still superior to regular infantry through their strength, self-healing and resistance to radiation and poison. 
* Eastasia has soldiers in powered armor (although the soldiers themselves seem to be basic humans, or picked from the best human soldiers, at most). They also have the [[Battle Angel]], a sentient [[gynoid]] superior to most of humanity in all aspects. The [[Shogun]], although not playable, is also superior to humans, having gained his powers through decades of training in the martial arts of the East, which involve aspects and powers not available in western training. Perhaps the same could be said of the [[Ninja|ShadowHand]]. Cyborg Hackers, too, to an extent, although they are hardly soldiers and more like engineers - in a physical battle between a regular soldier and a cybernetic hacker, the Hacker will most likely lose, unless there are gun turrets or similar devices around to manipulate to his advantage. In a battle between a fighter-bomber and a cybernetic hacker (or even a regular hacker on Elite) on the other hand... 
* Several mutants are so powerful they would easily qualify as supersoldiers or even superheroes if they acted in such a role. Regular mutants are superior to humans in most aspects (or vastly inferior in case the mutation takes a bad turn, but even those have increased resistances), and [[Tratos]], [[Yuri]] and, to some extent, [[Umagon]], are clearly super-powered. Soviet psychics are also mutants.

===Random Kingdom===
In ''Random Kingdom'', he is touched only superficially, as the obscure [[Soul of Darkness]] has taken over his role as the leader of [[The Reich]] and even wether [[World War Zero]] can be seen as parallel to World War II is subject to obscurity. If it is a future war, the historical World War II can be assumed to have taken place, although it may instead have been passed up for the ''Red Alert'' version. The ''October 2012 Revision'' mentions Hitler in relation to [[World War Zero]] in ''Human, all to Human'' and ''Gods and Ghosts''. Initially a human, he and other Nazis served as hosts to "demons" - the racial spirit of the germanic peoples - , becoming a sort of evil supermen (although with powers obviously not related to super strength). However, being human had profound effect on the beings, with Hitler, initially supposed to serve as nothing as a figurehead, manipulating people, taking his leadership role literal. His ultimate goal is a sort of elaborate enhanced suicide, killing himself and taking the world with him by causing an eternal war. As ''Random Kingdom'' is fantasy-touched, his plans are likewise making use of magic and pseudoscience, attempting to turn the population of the world into immortal undead so that the war may continue forever.
