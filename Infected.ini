;*** Infected type - differentiate from brainscorched and necromantic ***
; Just like the Brainscorched, these are not literally 'dead', they are infected with a mutating agent that has affected their physiology and is controlling their actions or has reduced/altered their mind. 
; Because of their altered physiology, it does not matter that they are not actually undead - they gain numerous of the immunities and altered reactions of 'true' necromantic undead.
