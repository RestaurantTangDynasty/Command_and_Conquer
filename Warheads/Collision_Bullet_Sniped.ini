; sniping with regular rifle bullet (single shot) - this gets a bonus on organic (infantry) targets, and no penalty VS armor since it's not hollow-point. Base damage is the SAME as regular bullet shot and the damage bonus is added via this warhead, otherwise math becomes messy as we would have to reduce the anti-vehicle damage on the warhead, which is harder to calculate.
