; This is mind-affecting radiation, whether mind-to-mind, or device-to-mind. 
; It does not include psychotropic materials, hence it is blocked by tinfoil (SEVA/psi protection, whether from gear or drugs), but penetrates hazmat. 
; Psychotropic materials are the opposite.

MindControl.Permanent		= yes		; logic forces this to be yes, since otherwise controller's death could revoke MC, but the AE would remain, killing the victim... that is not logical for a ray weapon, and a toxin-based weapon would make no sense to be revoked by controller's death at all. The only acceptable solution would be to edit the MC animation itself, as it is an "AE" that is revoked/tied to the MC status of the victim. However, changing the MC animation will have potential unforseen problems with other parts of the mod that may use MC logic (Hacking, for one, I can tell right now, and other Soviet MC units, which aren't clearly defined yet).
