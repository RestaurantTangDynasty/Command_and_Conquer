; Hollow-point, Sniping - Gains damage bonus on organic targets from ammo used (hollow point) and aiming for critical hits. Gets used against vehicles, but due to ammo used, effectiveness against armor is reduced, and there is no damage increase from sniping, as bullets which are so weak against armor cannot score critical hits - even if the sniper was to aim for the weak points of a vehicle, those points would still be made of a material impenetrable to hollow-point bullets.
