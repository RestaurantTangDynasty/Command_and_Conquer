Radiation			= yes						; Rad immunes do not suffer damage EVER, but when this is bound to tiberium, TiberiumProof-s do not either. TibProofs who are NOT rad-immune can still take damage from patches of radiation using this WH, and can't heal from it either. However, RadImmune and TibProof so far always go together anyways. 

; Because it is UNIQUELY used by map-bound patches of radiation and tiberium, the % chance of mutation to Visceroid will always apply to deaths from this WH - DO NOT USE it for any other weapon, because if you do, it will NEVER mutate its victims - it is regular rad death.
