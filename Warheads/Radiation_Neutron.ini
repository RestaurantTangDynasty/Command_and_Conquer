; Covert Ops II's Super2
; In Covert Ops II, this had 100% verses against everything. 
; However, as it's not supposed to be able to hit buildings anyway, I think it's permissible to keep the 
; 0% from NeutronFlash against those. 
; Likewise, it had the capability to damage Tiberium, cause fires (Sparky), and only dealt 60% prone damage. 
; Neither can and should fires be caused in the air, nor does Tiberium exist there to be damaged, nor can airbornes go prone. 
; I think it's acceptable to remove these.
