; This is the effect of Tiberium exposure. 
; Use this for Tiberium damage. 
; Also used as an upgrade (tech/veteran/per-unit purchase?) for Martyr/Fanatic. 
; Basic tiberium suiciders spread tiberium and maybe gas, 
; while upgraded tiberium suiciders gain a burst of tiberium radiation. 
; (So the inversion of chem units, which initially just spread chem, and then gain 
; explosive damage as a bonus.)
; Unlike the "bullet" version, this is contact "corruption", and is blocked 
; by hazmat/armor. 
; It's also not gas.
