; 1.	Reconsidering which faction uses the gas/chem 
;	2.	We separated gas from "the mutation force" now... Gas is again "just" poison gas. 
;	3.	That said, we already have the hallucination gas, it would make sense that the faction using this is the same as the faction using the other. And that would be Eurasia. 
*   The gases most suitable seem to be "LOST" and other WW1 things, but how do we move those over from being XÂ³? "LOST" is a cool name, but it is specific to the origin of the gas with 
    German researchers. 
    *   So using this for [Eurasia] would re-introduce the problem which we already sorted out by removing the "German" tech from the Soviet roster (Zeppelins, flak, V2/3/4, heavy tanks). 
*   [Trap, Chem]
*   This makes sense in combination with [Shock Infantry] - they are used to infiltrate past contaminated terrain. 
    *   Same as with radiation... 
*   Although we did separate gas and the "Mutation Factor", I think it is still warranted to consider mutagenic options from gas... this relates to the WH40K dilemma and also 
    [Princess Mononoke] in a way... (tararigami)


; Should this be the same as Gas_Poison? 
; I don't think it should be, as it shouldn't generate gas (it's a point effect).
