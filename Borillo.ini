
===Borillo===

====Equipment====
* Minigun

===Armadillo===
The Borillo serves in a variety of roles, from troop transport, to supply vehicle, to resource gatherer - and of course its' main function of breakthrough attack. 
Just as its' roles, he Borillo comes in a variety of weapon setups - its basic variant has a minigun, but the most commonly encountered setup is a brush-clearing howitzer. Like common with this class of weapons, the howitzer suffers from accuracy problems and is also not constructed for long-range bombardment, but rather for the short-range engagements mandated by the prohibitive terrain of [[Gondwana]]. The Borillo is used, without much alteration (at least faction-consistent modification patterns) by both Romera's government and the socialist revolutionaries that hide in the jungle. 

====Equipment====
* Dozer blade
* Howitzer

====Skills====
* '''155mm howitzer''' - Splash damage, [[bleed]], [[stun]], knockback from impact. 

====Notes====
* Under normal combat doctrine, the Borillo will advance upon its target while firing its' gun, attempting to ram it with its dozer blade. In a situation where this tactic is not desired, a Borillo can instead be ordered to dig in to remain stationary, gaining both increased accuracy and range with its gun, increased protection from incoming fire, and avoiding to expose oneself by driving straight into the enemy lines. When mobility is again required, the Borillo can dig out again on command. Both digging in and regaining mobility take a short period of time, so keep this delay in mind.
