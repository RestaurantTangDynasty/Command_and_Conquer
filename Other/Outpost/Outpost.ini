The CDF '''Outpost''' is armed with a howitzer in ''[[Red Alert 2: New World Order]]'', giving it considerable long-range defensive firepower against enemy infantry assaults and light vehicles. It is also capable of blocking traffic routes thanks to this long-distance weapon. Like all howitzers, this one is inaccurate, however it inflicts [[splash damage]], meaning it is still effective in engaging anything which does not require a direct hit to score a kill - which excludes all heavily armored vehicles. The Outpost can also be promoted to elite status, eliminating the inaccuracy as the crew gains better understanding of how to adjust their targeting to make up for ballistics. 

; Outposts serve as drop-off points for Command Center unit drops, have a build radius and and project a small healing/repair radius. They can also house a squad of infantry to defend them.
