; This is a flavor unit for the xenos minor factions. It is their epic unit. 
; Called by SW. Bombards area for a while before retreating. 
; Periodically teleports squads of infantry onto the ground. 
; Protected by massive force fields. Can be made to retreat by depleting shields. 
; This unit is listed as a VehicleType, but will be invoked as an AircraftType anyway, due to how the SW Type works.
