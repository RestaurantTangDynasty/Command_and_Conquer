(Virus Scud)
Presumed equivalent to other Russian sub-factions' Scud Barrage ability. This attack only fires a single missile which carries a potent biological warhead. Upon detonation, all organic units in a wide area are infected. Infected infantry die after a short time, infecting other uninfected infantry nearby. Does not damage Russian units. 

(Gehenna Scuds)
Fires incendiary missiles at the target area, drenching everything in flames. The potential area of effect is much smaller than the (map wide) potential area of the Virus Missile, but unlike the former, the conflagration caused by this attack can also damage vehicles and is a reliable way to raze any unhardened structure to the ground. 
    • Or perhaps this is 'just' a tactical nuclear missile. 'Just' in the sense of being identical to the generic Soviet/Russian tactical nuke. 
        ◦ Perhaps... generic Russian factions don't get access to the Nuke anymore, but only the Black Guard does? 
            ▪ And they call it "Gehenna Missile"?
