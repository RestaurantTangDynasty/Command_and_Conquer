; Penitent
; Criminal converted to a simple-minded attack cyborg. 
; I removed ImmuneToPoison, ImmuneToRadiation, ImmuneToPsionics. 
; Organic components should be damaged by poison and radiation. 
; Psionics should affect units which still have an organic brain, so set ImmuneToPsionics separately on those cyborgs which are supposed to be "slaved" to a CPU. 
; This is now the prototype. 
; "NOD" uses a version of this.
