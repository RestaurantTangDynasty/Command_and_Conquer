;*** Black Guard **************************************************************
;******************************************************************************
; Elite infantryman of the Black Guard of New Russia, armed with a laser gun.
; These soldiers are cyborgs. - 2015
; This is a little problematic – for a time, the Black Guard was conceived as a force of Soviet experimental cybernetic supersoldiers, dormant in a secret vault. - 2015


They are equipped with novel weapons and equipment, such as stealth suits and flechette carbines. All members of this organization also undergo extensive cybernetic enhancement. 

    • Conscript – Invalidated by new Conscript design and re-use of design similar to old Conscript design for Third Power infantry. 
    • Apocalypse Tank - 

Let's make it so – generic Russian units are old Soviet units, with limited technology. Black Guards units use modernized technology and have access to the same high technology as the Allies and EA, giving us another opportunity to use more beam weapons in additional colors, e.g. side-colored railguns and lasers. 
Infact, Black Guard can get further, Nod-inspired units – perhaps finally a way to implement the original Stealth Tank, or rather, a Stealth Tank which has as its distinguishing feature NOTHING beyond being stealth (although perhaps the missile armament should be kept). 

    • Black Guard – Infantry with laser rifle, makes separate RPG Conscript obsolete. 
    • Fanatic – Armed civilian, gather at the church in regular intervals. Some carry small arms, others molotow cocktails, still others have suicide vests. They cannot be directly controlled, but by using an SW, they can be told to move to certain areas, where they will attack enemies on their own accord. 
        ◦ May not be feasible. So either they appear at Church, and can be manually controlled, OR: 
        ◦ they appear at SW target location, cannot be controlled and attack on own accord (and move around a little, IsCow). 
    • Chem Tank – Maybe use Chem weapons over flame weapons in anti-infantry role for BG. 
    • Flame Tank
    • Reliquary – Supports penitents in some way. Perhaps can also catch civvies or enemy infantry and convert them into penitents, or ship them to a building which can do so. 
    • Stealth Tank – Unique unit. Missile-armed, cloakable (like original Nod Stealth Tank). 
    • Bomb Truck
    • Hind – Recol, but same as Soviet tech. 
    • Perhaps BG does not get Katyusha, Scud or even Pikes – ie nothing artillery-related. I'm not sure why, but none of these units seemed fitting for them. And it emerges that all of the units that all three are artillery units, leaving the BG without LRFS of any kind. Which probably means that it does not fit the faction. 
        ◦ Of course, on a mission basis, they can commandeer the regular units' artillery when needed, for example two Pikes stationed to guard the Kremlin. 


Black Guard Confessor
A Commissar of the Black Guard, armed with a laser pistol. 
    • This unit fulfills the same role as the Soviet Commissar. It can be trained by all Russian factions. 
    • Confessors have weaker laser guns than the larger carbine models of the regular infantrymen. However, they have the same rate of fire and substantially more HP.
