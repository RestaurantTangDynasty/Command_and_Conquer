; This is the _human_ Controller, as opposed to the _mutant_ Controller. 
; (Although both are mutants, the Mutant Controller is more mutated. 
; (It is also distinct from the Xen Controller.)
; Moved to Eurasia, changed ID from Controller_YU to Controller_Human. Not sure what it was doing in Yuri's Army anyway, as we decided early in '21 that the "Yuris" would be split into giving SU the "old" Yuri. :: '21-9-11
