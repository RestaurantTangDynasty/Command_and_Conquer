;*** Mad Bomber ***************************************************************
;******************************************************************************
; This is related to the Grenadier, Machinist, Saboteur, Spy and, of course, Bomber in general. 
; The Machinist deals some damage to a building, sacrificing himself, if it is not damaged enough (otherwise, he captures it). 
; Saboteur and Spy have disabling, but not destructive, effects on buildings (except for Fake structures). 
; The "Bomber" is the synthesis of the D2K Saboteur, TW Fanactic, RA2 Terrorist, Gen/ZH Terrorist, TDR Martyr. 
; The lowest level of that unit simply runs at the target and blows himself up, dealing some damage. 
; The next stage runs to the target and blows it up, sacrificing himself. 
; The next stage runs to the target, attaching C4 which will destroy any building. 
; The vanilla Crazy Ivan (here: Mad Bomber) can attach bombs to any type of target, but isn't as devastating as C4. 
; This unit is a Disabler! It is differentiated from the Bomber! 
; Crazy Ivan is the hero of, and derived from, this.
