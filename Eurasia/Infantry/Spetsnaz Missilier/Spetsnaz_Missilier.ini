This is my first attempt to make an infantry shp. Unlike many others, it is made by copy&paste method from some original units, but it looks very good.

Soviet Tank Killer is a soldier in modern Russian army outfit (somewhat like Spetznaz/VDV) armed with PTG (Protivotankoviy Granatomet, or just Anti-Tank Missile launcher). May be suitable for an Allied unit, though.

It has been originally made for the Conflict of the Nations mod. You may use it in your mod, but you should give credit to me for it.

Below is the code for this unit. You may edit any of the stats that you want to, but be sure you know what you're doing.
