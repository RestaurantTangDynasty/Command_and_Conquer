; 1. The ordinarily-armed radiation-protected infantry is the Liquidator. 
;	* Should they be merged?
;	* Then there are: 
;		2.  Hasardeur
                        a.  Black Guard Hasardeur
                        1/2.    Shock Infantry x Hasardeur => Assault Hasardeur
                                1.   That would be one possibility. But I think "Hasardeur" already in its original meaning implies something of "Arditi", of daring. That already makes it 
                                a suited name for Shock Infantry on its own. 
                                    1.   Shock Infantry x Liquidator => Hasardeur? That would tie in the Liquidator as well. 
                                        *   "Liquidator" should not be the ordinary infantry, should it? The unit called "Desolator" in vanilla liquifies his victims, 
                                        perhaps the name "Liquidator" should be used for this unit? 
                                2.   The division of Hasardeur and Black Guard Hasardeur seems to imply that the vanilla Conscript model is to be used for the Hasardeur and the 
                                black Conscript model recolor is to be used for the Black Guard Hasardeur. 
                                    1.   This is in contrast to the "Venom" faction concept, where the basic infantry "Hasardeur" used black Conscript model recolor. 
                                    2.   
; We have realigned this now as follows: 
; 1. The regular "hazmat" infantry is the Hasardeur. 
; 2. This is the base-class of Shock and Flamer (and a possible gas/chem infantry). 
; 3. It is the vanilla Conscript. 
; 4. Hasardeurs are the normal infantry of the Molots, they are not available to any other faction. 
; 5. Hasardeurs lack an upgrade that regular Soviet infantry has, which is the AK74. They use PPSh41. 
; 6. They can be upgraded, making them Assault Hasardeur. 
; 7. Black Guards have their own Black Guard Hasardeur, it does not have an upgrade yet and I'm not quite sure how it fits in. 
; 8. The name "Liquidator" was given to the vanilla Desolator, which is now an Iraqi unit again.
