; Eurasian Dominion; 
A '''Dominion''' is one of the constituent territories of [[Oceania]]. Because Oceanian territories are geographically disparate, individual lords are given considerable leeway in how they run their particular area of influence, as long as they freely trade with the rest of the Empire and keep the necessary contributions of men and material to the war effort. Because of this, technology and local defense forces also vary widely between dominions, adapted to the necessities of local infrastructure and environment as well the preferences of a particular governor.

New Russia is a state and a playable faction in Continuum. It is a theocracy that succeeded the anarchy of the "wild" 90s and early 2000s, following the collapse of the Soviet Union. New Russia occasionally has internal conflicts with warlords, oligarchs and Soviet remnants. 


==Units & Buildings==
Dominions vary widely in military hardware and unit composition. Dominion hardware is not regularly buildable to frontline Allied commanders, but may be commandeered or engaged in missions. They are some sort of allied neutral map units/structures. Across the board, these units are much weaker than the regular Allied units, although in some cases specialized units may perform quite well in their given terrain, given that they employ adapted technology. In such situations, they may outperform the regular Allied units, if employed correctly.
