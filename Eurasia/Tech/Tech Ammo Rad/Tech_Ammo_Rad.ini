;*** Tech Ammo Rad ************************************************************
;******************************************************************************
; Lowest-tier rad ammo. 
; The higher tier is "added effect" radiation (dirty bomb). 
; The tier above that is nuclear shells. 
; The highest tier is the "[Lance Atomiq]". 
; Irradiating ammo is for artillery only. 
; Fist is artillery (heavy tank and howitzer rolled into one), and can use it. 
; Consider using it for FROG/Scud as well. Seems even better than gas. Though why does it seem that way? 
; There was only Fist and FROG/Scud, no howitzer, but now there are other units which can use this. 
; Molots and Iraq get this for free.
