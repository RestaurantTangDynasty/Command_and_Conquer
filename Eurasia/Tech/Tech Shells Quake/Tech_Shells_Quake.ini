Gain access to unique, targeted Quake shells. These shells contain a larger payload than usual and feature a ballistic cap and delayed-action fuze, designed to penetrate into the ground before detonating. The shells are fired with twice the propellant of a regular shell, to deliver their greater weight. This increases the range of this special attack by 100% compared to regular shells. The shells are ineffective against infantry and vehicles, but will cause significant damage to buildings in the area.
