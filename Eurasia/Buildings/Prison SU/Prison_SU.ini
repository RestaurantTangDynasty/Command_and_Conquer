;******************************************************************************
; This building takes captured infantry, and converts them into "Defector ~~~~". 
; Defectors are _not_ under MC, but are brainwashed with "ordinary" means. 
; PsiCorps (and YuriArmy) factions have a "psi" version of this structure, which is much more effective. 
; This structure derives from Allied Prison (Detention Camp). 
; Asian Re-education Center derives from this structure. It just has a different model. 
; Forgotten Slaver/Market is distinct from this track, because Market is a structure in its own right.
