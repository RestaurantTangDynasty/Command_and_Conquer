; Cyborg Tank
;; Give it a flamethrower and an autocannon
; Has ATP chaingun, missile pod, BFG. 
; Chainguns/autocannons & rockets are state-of-the-art right now, but (just like mech), it kind of seems right that it should have a third weapon. 
; If it seems right, don't restrict because of Primary/Secondary restriction, if that is the only reason to restrict to chaingun/rockets. 
; Used to have a deploy self-destruct as well, but this is probably not re-creatable without freeing up Secondary. 
; Stick ATP on this unit?

Cyborg Tank
The Cyborg Tank is designed as an intermediate-effectiveness counter towards both infantry and vehicles. It cannot defeat its own value in anti-tank infantry, nor defeat its own value in armored vehicles, however it out-competes armored vehicles in the anti-infantry role, and infantry in the anti-vehicle role. 
Because its large size makes it an equally easy target to anti-tank missiles as any other vehicle of its size, it is vulnerable to them, completely ignoring any added resistances due to its organic nature. Bullets, on the other hand, do greatly reduced damage, but still more than to purely inorganic targets, such as armored vehicles.
