; Formerly Giraffe-Weevil Repair Drone. 
; [azri_apoc's Laser Drone and Sniper Drone are [scorpioid]. 
; And [scorpioid] is the [REPAIR] (Nod Repair Droid). 
; If [REPAIR] was the Allied repair drone, this would be isoaesthetic, and 
; reflect [implied link between Nod and the military-industrial complex]. 
;
; The hover repair drone design has a Soviet aesthetic, and was originally designed for Soviets.]
; And the "[Nano Repair Unit]" can be included from [C&C: Devastation], which still 
; gives AA a technological step up. Although that implies giving them nanotechnology... 
;
; Nanotechnology is now a "generalized tech", so that should not be a problem anymore.
