; Difficult one, this is a mutant, I guess, or natural wildlife? 
; However, the available image, and the fact that squids do not naturally attack ships 
; (unless this is a mutant)
; Discourage its appearance as wildlife. 
; They are trained (and possibly bred?) as part of a Soviet military project. 
; They would be available to Soviets, 
; but Yuri would also have defected with the tech, or hardware. 
; 
; The Shepherds have an emerald-green version instead of this.
