Black Guard Tank
Black Guard only operates the new T-80 model. The heavy IS-10 Stalin's Fist is only used by older Soviet-style tank regiments, although two IS-10, operated by the Black Guard, are permanently posted to guard the Kremlin. 

It means, make a new black-recol T-80 model (ie Nod scheme)! 
Stat-wise, it can probably be identical to the T-80.
