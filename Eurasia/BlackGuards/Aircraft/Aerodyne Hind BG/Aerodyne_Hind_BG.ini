; A recolored model used by the Black Guard. 
; Has a slightly different weapon loadout, being equipped with a psi emitter. 
With its armament, the Hind can snipe enemy armor from the air or provide limited anti-air cover. It can also engage infantry, but because of the limited volume of fire it can deploy, it is not effective against large numbers of targets. 
; Planned to be equipped with railguns and seeker missiles in 2015.
