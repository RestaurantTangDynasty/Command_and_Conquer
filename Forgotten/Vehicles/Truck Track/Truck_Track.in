;******************************************************************************
; The heavy halftrack. It can load any weapons that can also fit on the Pickup, but that's not efficient. 
; It can equip Quad Cannon, cannon, howitzer, mortar, rocket launchers. 
; This unit can upgrade from the Mortar Truck (Vietnam has access to this unit). 
; But Quad Cannon, howitzer, cannon cannot be used from the truck unless it has the HT upgrade.
