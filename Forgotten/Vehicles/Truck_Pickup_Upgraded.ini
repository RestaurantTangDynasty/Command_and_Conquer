; The Gunwagon. This is the Pickup Truck, covered in scrap armor and given a weapon. 
; Chassis can be mated with: 
; a) All the weapons that can be mated with the Buggy: Gun, Rocket Rack
; b) HMG, Autocannon
; c) Mortar
; d) Flak
; e) Gatling (since apparently it can even carry a small cannon (as per Gen/ZH), this should be allowed). 
; This vehicle is supposed to be lighter than "armored car".
