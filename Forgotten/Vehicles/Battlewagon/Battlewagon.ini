;*** Gun Wagon ****************************************************************
;******************************************************************************
; An armored car with a heavy machine gun. Can carry infantry, has sensors, projects healing aura (ie the former experimental (for all but a few hours) WT19 BattleBus.
* Passengers are protected and can fire out.
* Elite upgrade is an aux targeting laser vs buildings, and TOW missiles vs buildings and vehicles.

===Medium Tank===
* Basic medium tank with APFSDS rounds.
* Elite upgrade is EMP rocket as aux vs vehicles, and canister shells vs infantry.
** Or rather, keep it simple, elite upgrade is an MG vs infantry.

===Mobile Artillery===
Two modes - mobile mode for direct fire, and deployed mode for (more longer-ranged) indirect fire over terrain obstacles. Both modes are inaccurate. Effective vs structures and infantry (due to blast zone despite inaccuracy), but ineffective vs vehicles (except light).
* Elite upgrade is a cluster shell.
