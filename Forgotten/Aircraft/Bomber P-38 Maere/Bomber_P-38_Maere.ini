;*** P-38 Maere ***************************************************************
;******************************************************************************
; Allied light bomber dating back to World War II. 
; Residual unit from YRXÂ³, found in the code of YRNWO, removed in the version update, then re-put in during the '12/12 as a unit for the new South Vietnam faction. 
; It is still an out-dated plane, residual from allied stocks of the Pacific War. 
; Armed with
; 20mm autocannon - Peppers infantry and light vehicles with 20mm shot 
; and a load of bombs - regular light explosive bombs, comparable to StuKa's but dropped in a short line (shorter than big bomber aircraft), rather than a point like the StuKa's. Used vs buildings and heavy vehicles. 
; Elite upgrade is rocket bombs. Fires inaccurate rocket bombs at the target, allowing for standoff distance on all types of target. 
; Its attack range is limited exclusively to ground targets, deploying its 20mm gun on targets infront of it as it strafes them, and its rocket bombs from right above the target. 
; Both weapons are used in strafing runs.
