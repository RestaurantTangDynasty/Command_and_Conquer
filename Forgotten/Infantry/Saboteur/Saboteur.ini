; This unit is a Disabler! It is differentiated from the Bomber! 
; When infiltrating, in Gen/ZH, 
; Command Center resets countdown timer for all enemy General's Powers. 
; Super weapons reset the countdown timer. 
    Supply center/Supply stash - steals $1000 from the enemy. If the enemy has less than $1000 in total, the saboteur will steal all remaining supplies.
    Barracks/war factory/airfield - disables targeted building for 30 seconds.
    Strategy center/Propaganda center/Supply drop zone/Black market/Internet center - disables targeted building for 15 seconds.
; Entering a power plant turns off power for 30 seconds.
; Fake structures explode immediately. 
; In Contra, 
; A Command Center increases countdown timer for all enemy General's Powers.
    Entering a Supply Drop Zone steals $800 from the enemy.
    Entering a Supply Center steals $1000 from the enemy.
    Entering a War Factory or a Barracks paralyzes production for 1 minute.
; So, there is considerable variance from the Spy and Shinobi. 
; I think production facility disablement can be achieved by giving these structures a small "aura" that deals fatal damage to Saboteurs when they almost enter. 
; The warhead used will use a variety of means to suppress audivisual cues to the player. 
; The Saboteur in return gets a death weapon that EMP's in a narrow area of effect (one cell), and can only affect those production facilities.
