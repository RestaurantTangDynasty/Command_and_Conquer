;*** Commander Juhziz *********************************************************
;******************************************************************************
; This is Commander Juhziz. 
; He is a Legendary Blaster. 
; Around him, all explosive damage becomes boosted. 
; When he dies, he explodes with an earth-shattering kaboom, dealing massive 
; damage to all objects on the map. Only objects with the highest possible health 
; (this may be the Con Yard)
; can survive, on their last HP, and only if fully repaired. 
; In combat, he attacks by launching quick-timed explosive charges (5000 dmg) against his targets. 
; These have to be removed by an Engineer, as they have a substantial AoE and can take out an entire force 
; if allowed to detonate. 
; In between using those charges, he uses a "regular" (5000 dmg) grenade launcher. 
; In addition, Juhziz is almost immune to any explosive damage (HE, AP, etc. and variants thereof). 
; He can only be killed with bullets/slugs, meelee, or energy weapons. 
; His aura constantly produces explosive traps around him.
