Name=Force of the Shore
Briefing=

Force Of The Shore

Force of the Shore is an interlude following the revelations of "Blank Infinity". The Soviets begin their assault of the continental US. The player leads the naval landing spearhead against Washinghton D.C.

Unlike the nuclear destruction the player is to unleash in "Mother Of Light", the American civilization fades out quite softly – people flock to Communism and Islam. Everybody is happy. American culture is overlaid by later culture – the Russian culture – and is thus "Consigned to Oblivion". The player must direct a force of Soviets to raze the last capital of the Allies – Bolivion, the fortified former Bolivia.

;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[GDI1A]
1=Emergency transmissions from GDI forces in this region indicate that
2=Phoenix Base is under attack from Nod troops. It is imperative that
3=the base be restored by building a Tiberium Refinery and a Barracks.
4=Once the base is functional, all Nod forces in the area must be destroyed.@@
5=Objective One: Build a Tiberium Refinery.@@
6=Objective Two: Build a Barracks.@@
7=Objective Three: Destroy all Nod forces.

Name=Secure The Region
Briefing=GDI2A
VoiceOver=GDI-02.AUD

;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[GDI2A]
1=The Nod forces that attacked Phoenix Base have been traced back to a small
2=base in this sector. Orders received from GDI Command state that the Nod
3=base must be destroyed. However, there is a significant civilian population
4=in the immediate area that must be evacuated by ORCA Transport before the
5=fighting gets too heavy. Before the Transports can safely land, all seven
6=SAM sites must be destroyed. Once the civilians have been evacuated, the Nod
7=base can be destroyed.@@
8=Objective One: Deploy the M.C.V. and begin building a base.@@
9=Objective Two: Destroy all Nod SAM sites.@@
10=Objective Three: Destroy the Nod base.


; GDI Mission 3A
[GDI3A.MAP]
Name=Secure Crash Site
Briefing=GDI3A
VoiceOver=GDI-03A.AUD

[GDI3A]
1=GDI forces in this sector have found something unusual and large that
2=crashed nearby. Nod has taken an intense interest in whatever it is, so
3=naturally we are interested as well. Locate the object from the reports
4=and capture any Nod Technology Centers in the area that might have uncovered
5=clues as to the identity of the object.@@
6=Objective One: Locate the Crash Site.@@
7=Objective Two: Capture any Nod Technology Centers.


; GDI Mission 3B
[GDI3B.MAP]
Name=Capture Train Station
Briefing=GDI3B
VoiceOver=GDI-03B.AUD

[GDI3B]
1=Nod has positioned a supply base in the area near a civilian train
2=station. We can use the train and supplies to infiltrate the larger
3=Nod base to the east. Avoiding patrols where possible and destroy all the
4=Nod structures in the area. Once the area is secure, capture the train
5=station for our use. DO NOT destroy the station or the train, as they
6=are vital to our plans. Engineers and other reinforcements are available,
7=but not unlimited - do not waste them.@@
8=Objective One: Destroy all Nod structures.@@
9=Objective Two: Capture the train station.

[GDI4A.MAP]
Name=Defend Crash Site
Briefing=GDI4A
VoiceOver=GDI-04.AUD

[GDI4A]
1=Whatever is contained in this craft, it is apparent that Nod doesn't want
2=GDI to have it. Protect the crashed UFO until GDI reinforcements can arrive
3=to fortify the area.@@
4=Objective One: Survive until reinforcements can arrive.@@
5=Objective Two: Prevent Nod from destroying the UFO.


; GDI Mission 5A
[GDI5A.MAP]
Name=Destroy Radar Array
Briefing=GDI5A
VoiceOver=GDI-05A.AUD

[GDI5A]
1=Destroy the three relay stations and the radar array to blackout Nod's
2=sensor net. This will make rescuing Tratos easier, as Nod will not be as
3=quick to detect you.@@
4=Objective One: Destroy the three relay stations.@@
5=Objective Two: Destroy the radar array.


; GDI Mission 5B
[GDI5B.MAP]
Name=Rescue Tratos
Briefing=GDI5B
VoiceOver=GDI-05B.AUD

[GDI5B]
1=Nod is experimenting on mutant survivors at a facility in this sector.
2=Among them is Tratos, leader of the mutants. Using Umagon's strike team,
3=rescue Tratos from imprisonment and EVAC him at the specified site.
4=Once complete, move in with GDI forces and destroy the Nod base and the
5=prison test facility.@@

; GDI Mission 6A
[GDI6A.MAP]
Name=Destroy Vega's Dam
Briefing=GDI6A
VoiceOver=GDI-06A.AUD

[GDI6A]
1=The hydroelectric dams in this area provide Vega's island fortress with
2=almost limitless power. Destroying the dams will seriously cripple Vega's
3=perimeter defenses and allow GDI to bring more weapons to bear against
4=Vega's base.@@
5=The dams are heavily fortified, so attacking them directly is not the best
6=option. Surveillance indicates the key to destroying the dams lies in the
7=destruction of two regulator stations. Without them, the dams' generators
8=will overload and the dams will self destruct.@@
9=Objective One: Destroy the dams any way possible.


; GDI Mission 6B
[GDI6B.MAP]
Name=Destroy Vega's Base
Briefing=GDI6B
VoiceOver=GDI-06B.AUD

[GDI6B]
1=Vega's base of operations is in the area. It is heavily guarded by SAM
2=sites, and a secondary outpost provides reinforcements. Destroy all Nod
3=forces in the area, but capture Vega's Pyramid intact - there is
4=information there that we can use. You will have only limited troops
5=until the SAM sites are neutralized one way or another.@@
6=Objective One: Destroy the Nod base.@@
7=Objective Two: Capture Vega's Pyramid.


; GDI Mission 7A
[GDI7A.MAP]
Name=Capture Hammerfest Base
Briefing=GDI7A
VoiceOver=GDI-07.AUD

[GDI7A]
1=Hammerfest base has been overrun by Nod troops. The Firestorm walls
2=block direct approach, so another route must be found back into the
3=complex. Using hover MLRS and waterways for access, find a way back
4=to the GDI base and re-capture it. Once the base is back in GDI hands,
5=destroy all Nod forces in the area.@@
6=Objective One: Find a way back to the GDI base.@@
7=Objective Two: Re-capture the base with engineers.@@
8=Objective Three: Destroy all Nod forces in the area.


; GDI Mission 8A
[GDI8A.MAP]
Name=Retrieve Disrupter Crystals
Briefing=GDI8A
VoiceOver=GDI-08.AUD

[GDI8A]
1=It is imperative that you prevent the train carrying the crystals from
2=reaching the Nod base. Recent ice melts in the region have washed out
3=the only train bridge. However, Nod engineers are on their way to repair
4=it, so you must move quickly. If you can get to the train before the
5=bridge is repaired, we can recover the crystals with little trouble.
6=Otherwise, we will have to assault the Nod base to reclaim the crystals.
7=Remember, to stop the train, you must destroy the locomotive, not the
8=cars, but the cargo car holds the crystals.@@
9=Objective One: Locate the train and destroy the locomotive before Nod
10=engineers repair the bridge. The cargo car holds the crystals.@@
11=Objective Two: If the bridge is repaired and the train successfully
12=reaches the Nod base, then you must locate and destroy this base to recover
13=the crystals.


; GDI Mission 9A
[GDI9A.MAP]
Name=Rescue Prisoners
Briefing=GDI9A
VoiceOver=GDI-09A.AUD

[GDI9A]
1=Umagon has requested help to rescue her people from a Nod prison.
2=The prison is located on an island to the east. Nod has a strong force
3=in the area, both in outposts and spread through the nearby city. We have
4=limited resources and no reinforcements are available, so avoiding patrols
5=is vital to your success. Umagon has a team in the area already - if you
6=can find them, they may assist you. Make your way to the prison and release
7=the hostages. Once the prison is secure, we will send a transport to evacuate
8=Umagon's people. There may be SAM sites nearby, so make sure the way is
9=clear for the transport.@@
10=Objective One: Locate the Nod prison.@@
11=Objective Two: Release and evacuate the prisoners.


; GDI Mission 9B
[GDI9B.MAP]
Name=Destroy Chemical Supply
Briefing=GDI9B
VoiceOver=GDI-09B.AUD

[GDI9B]
1=This chemical supply station is providing vast quantities of Tiberium toxins
2=to a number of Nod research programs in the area. Destroying this site will
3=seriously hinder further Nod research, and prevent this base from transporting
4=reinforcements to others in the sector.@@
5=Intelligence reports advise caution when near any of the chemical tanks and
6=facilities, as the toxins contained within are highly corrosive and equally
7=deadly to soldiers and vehicles.@@
8=Objective One: Find a suitable location for a base.
9=Objective Two: Destroy the Nod Chemical station.


; GDI Mission 9C
[GDI9C.MAP]
Name=Mine Power Grid
Briefing=GDI9C
VoiceOver=GDI-09C.AUD

[GDI9C]
1=If the upcoming GDI attack on the missile sites is to succeed, C4 must be
2=planted at all six power stations. The power grid is well protected, but the
3=train should carry the demolition team and the mutants through the gates and
4=past the guards. If Nod forces discover the demolition team and sound the alert,
5=take out the power plants by any means available.@@
6=Objective One: Plant C4 at the power plants.


; GDI Mission 9D
[GDI9D.MAP]
Name=Destroy Chemical Missile Plant
Briefing=GDI9D
VoiceOver=GDI-09D.AUD

[GDI9D]
1=Nod's main chemical missile plant is located in this area. It is responsible
2=for the large amount of Tiberium poisoning and accelerated mutations of wildlife
3=in the surrounding areas. Destroying this facility will prevent Nod from
4=furthering the acceleration of Tiberium poisoning on the planet.@@
5=Objective One: Destroy Nod's missile silos.@@
6=Objective Two: Destroy all Nod forces.


; GDI Mission 10A
[GDI10A.MAP]
Name=Destroy Prototype Facility
Briefing=GDI10A
VoiceOver=GDI-10A.AUD

[GDI10A]
1=One of two possible locations of the Prototype Manufacturing Facility. Use the
2=mutants to locate the position of the production facility. The mutants must remain
3=undetected. If Nod suspects enemy forces in the area, they will cloak the facility
4=and deploy troops to destroy them. If the mutants can hide from the Nod troops for
5=a short period, the base will assume the area is clear and uncloak. Once we
6=record the location of the base, GDI Dropships will arrive with reinforcements.@@
7=Objective One: Using mutants you must locate the Prototype Manufacturing Facility.@@
8=Objective Two: Once the facility is located, reinforcements will be sent in to help
9=construct a base. You are to destroy the Manufacturing Facility at this time.


; GDI Mission 10B
[GDI10B.MAP]
Name=Babylon
Briefing=GDI10B
VoiceOver=GDI-10B.AUD

[GDI10B]
1=Iraq has fallen to SCORPION and serves as a massive recruitment base for the 
2=organization. This alone should be reason enough to make short work of SCORPIONs
3=presence in that country. What is more, recent intel data suggests that
4=SCORPION has stored parts of its VENOM code in a zionist research facility in 
5=the ruins of Babel.


; GDI Mission 11A
[GDI11A.MAP]
Name=Finale at Cairo
Briefing=GDI11A
VoiceOver=GDI-11.AUD

[GDI11A]
1=Scans of this region have shown an increase of comm output from Cairo, suggesting SCORPION 
2=will launch its world-altering superweapon within hours. You must destroy the local Zone and 
3=its comm devices before the virus is unleashed. There are no other strategies.@@
4=Objective One: Clear the zone for MCV Dropship deployment.@@
5=Objective Two: Destroy the ICBM launchers.@@
6=Objective Three: Destroy the Pyramid Temple.@@
7=Objective Four: Destroy all Nod forces.


; GDI Mission 12A
[GDI12A.MAP]
Name=Aftermath
Briefing=GDI12A
VoiceOver=GDI-12.AUD

[GDI12A]
1=The last stronghold of SCORPION lies here: The well-defended ZONE of Israel
2=and SCORPION's largest Vault, Mt. Zion. The many confrontations over the
3=last weeks have severely crippled SCORPION's forces and have diverted
4=much of the organizations military power to other places, were it has been
5=smashed by the ARRF. However, a large protective force field is still online, 
6=protecting the Zone from any major outside interference.
7=The force field projectors, however, are poorly guarded now and a small 
8=team led by you should be able to overpower the remaining military presence, 
9=disable the network and allow massive bombardment of all SCORPION facilities
10=left in the area.@@
11=Objective One: Use Tanya's strike team to locate and disable the generators
12=that power the Zion forcefield.
13=Objective Two: Once the forcefield is down, begin strategic bombardment of
14=SCORPION's Mount Zion Vault.

[NOD6B]
1=You must reach the medical colony in the region without being prematurely detected
2=by GDI and forcing a base evacuation. To prevent this, consider first destroying
3=the three sensor towers protecting the base. Our new artillery unit should be
4=sufficient for the job. Once inside the base, the capture of the mutant female
5=should be easy.@@
6=Objective One: Find and destroy the GDI sensor towers without getting too close

[NOD10A]
1=GDI is set to test the prototype of their new weapon, the Mammoth Mark II.
2=It is vital that we sabotage their production of this monster as soon as
3=possible. Before we can do that however, we need to know where the test is
4=being held. Send a Chameleon Spy into one of the Radar Facilities. The
5=coordinates to the testing ground should be stored there. Be careful of the
6=patrols in the area - we have only one spy available. Once we have the location
7=of the test, construct a base and destroy the prototype. You now have access to
8=the new Banshee aircraft, which should prove useful. Destroying the remainder
9=of the GDI base is at your discretion, but the Mammoth MUST be destroyed.@@

1=The Shiners have been processed to pure Tiberium. The substances extracted from their bodies
2=will now serve us to broadcast our codes into every Tiberium-driven energy system on the 
3=face of this planet, as well as the Tiberium itself. Within hours, every human settlement not
4=protected by SCORPION will be overrun by Tiberium-based lifeforms and either wiped of the 
5=face of the planet or incorporated into a crystalline megastructure. Our operatives have 
6=placed Tiberium "beacons" on certain key locations around the world. Unfortunately, the ARRF
7=has received word of at least some of these locations, and is prepairing massive strikes
8=against the beacons. Their informant is currently dying a long and painful death, but
9=the damage is done. So we need you, commander, to protect the final stages of the operation:

2=We were wrong. The ARRF has still managed to somehow secure Washington DC from
3=the adverse effects of VENOM, and is currently amassing forces in the city.
4=While this is a minor threat to the plan as a whole, this thorn has still to 
5=be pulled from our flesh before it incinerates. The numerous settlers of SCORPION
6=that were killed when moving into the area unsuspectingly will have to be avenged as well.
7=We suggest that, instead of using massive military forces against the dug-in ARRF, 
8=their pathetic defense measures shoudl be breached by a small team, deploying a portable 
9=VENOM emitter.@@
