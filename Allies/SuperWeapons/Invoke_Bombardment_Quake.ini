;*** Bombardment Seismic ******************************************************
;******************************************************************************
; Invokes a bomber to drop a bomb seismic on the target. 
; The bomb burrow into the ground and detonate with a slight delay, causing an earthquake. 
; It deals catastrophic damage at the point of impact, and widespread damage, to structures. 
; It ignores the added protection of underground structures. 
; Infantry and vehicles are harmed little by this weapon. 
; It is an alternate upgrade to Invoke_Bombardment_Thermo - you can only have one or the other. 
; Air Armada can have both, but using one resets the timer for both of them. 
; General Granger himself can use both with separate timers.
