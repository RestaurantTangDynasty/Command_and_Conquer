{{main|Vengeance Launcher}}
The '''Vengeance Launcher''' is a TEL, carrying a single [[Vengeance Missile]]. It must be deployed to fire and can then attack any location on the map. Each launcher is only good for a single attack and becomes a somewhat-useless flatbed truck after firing. The missile inflicts damage equal to a direct hit by a nuke, however it uses a high explosive warhead and does not leave residual radiation. As it is essentially a superweapon available freely from the Factory in unlimited number, the Vengeance Launcher is one of the best artillery pieces in the game.
