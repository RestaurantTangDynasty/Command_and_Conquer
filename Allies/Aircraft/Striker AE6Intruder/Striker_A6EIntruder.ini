This is a 3ds modelled Grumman A6E Intruder, supposedly the allied plane for allies in early stages of RA2 (so supposedly its even named intruder in the game parameters). You will notice its very similar to the gameÂ´s harrier, this is because the Harrier is similar to the Intruder in real life, even if there are differences, which EA/WS doesnt seem to know of (look at the nose of the Harrier in RA2, its bad shaped. Guess why, because its an Intruder nose...)

This asset was originally made for YR: Lightning Shift, by Pyromeleon, hosted at http://cncguild.net. The download remains exclusively at YR Argentina, but of course you may include it in your mod (what would be the point if you couldnt, eh)

All you have to do is say, "Wow, this voxel looks like one of Westwoods". I wont hear it, but you saying it raises my ego a little bit, and helps me produce more goodies. So, go ahead and say it ;)

As a side note, youll notice the HVA is wrong. Work it out. 3ds2vxl outputs it wrong every time, and im tired of fixing it.
