;******************************************************************************
Because the Europeans were rarely on the offensive, assault guns did not become a popular branch of development and investment in their armed forces. Instead, mobile artillery was used to provide fire support to defenders and contain infantry assaults. The European mobile artillery is unarmored, but highly mobile and long-ranged. Its high-explosive fragmentation shells are highly effective against infantry, but less so against armored units or buildings. 
Artillery is crewed by Guards and upon promotion, upgrades to use cluster shells. 


The '''155mm Howitzer ''Long Tom''''' is an [[Allies|allied]] artillery unit on a self-propelled chassis. Its range is significantly smaller than that of most other artillery weapons, especially compared to the [[90mm Mortar]], [[155mm Mortar]] and [[160mm Howitzer]], being only slightly larger than that of a tank gun, and it functions as a tactical support weapon. The Long Tom regulary fires HE shells to devastating effect.

The Base.Class for the 155mm Howitzer is the '''[[Long Tom]]'''.
