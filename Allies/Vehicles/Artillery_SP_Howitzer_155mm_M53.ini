;******************************************************************************
Because the Europeans were rarely on the offensive, assault guns did not become a popular branch of development and investment in their armed forces. Instead, mobile artillery was used to provide fire support to defenders and contain infantry assaults. The European mobile artillery is unarmored, but highly mobile and long-ranged. Its high-explosive fragmentation shells are highly effective against infantry, but less so against armored units or buildings. 
Artillery is crewed by Guards and upon promotion, upgrades to use cluster shells.
