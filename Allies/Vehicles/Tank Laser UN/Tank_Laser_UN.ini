			     WOLFPACK MOD
			      BETA V0.99
			     BY FLAMEWOLF

        New Unit Concepts: FlameWolf, Gex (for the Laser Tank idea)
  1.3 Special Thanks: To Jrpereira, Brian Bird, Leetaur, MOlson,
      Kaje, Chevanater, anyone else I may have missed, Westwood for
      making the best damn game I ever played (Tiberian Sun), all of
      you reading this for actually reading the text file (; and anyone
      who has supported my site or my creations. Thanks a lot!


      GDI Assault Tank: Mechs may be the future of warfare, but that
      doesn't mean tanks are obsolete. GDI, realizing the value of
      cheaper yet still sturdy combat units, created the Assault Tank.
      It uses a fairly strong weapon, but has slightly weaker armor
      than the Titan.

      Mammoth Tank: Of course, we all know what this is. The Mammoth
      has been enabled for this mod.

      Sonic Mech: A small, weakly armored mech that employs the
      devastating Disruptor technology. Paired up with the stronger
      Disruptor Tanks, the Sonic Mech can make an excellent backup
      unit thanks to its ability to rapidly dish out punishment. Its
      armor, however, is too weak to sustain much damage.



      Orca Interceptor: The basic Orca fighter chassis has had the
      missile racks and ammo bays stripped off and replaced with dual
      laser cannons and an energy cell. The Interceptor can fly
      swiftly into an enemy base, unload its laserfire onto the target
      structure, and escape quickly. The laser cell must be recharged
      at designated pads.

      Stealth Infantry: Identical to the basic light infantry unit,
      except this one has a cloaking suit that makes him invisible
      to the enemy. They are twice as expensive as normal light infantry,
      but the ambush potential in these units makes the cost worth it.

      Laser Tank: This unit is similar to Nod's Tick Tank, except it
      cannot deploy, and uses a laser rather than a cannon as its
      weapon.

      Flame Harpy: The Harpy's regular chaingun has been replaced with
      flamethrowers. Its role remains much the same, anti-infantry,
      but it is now more effective in fulfilling that role.

      Neutron Crawler: An incredibly fast dune crawler armed with short-ranged,
      rapid-firing proton missiles. Armor is light and weapon is crap, but
      this is the fastest ground unit you'll ever see.


      Mega Obelisk: Nod's regular Obelisk is effective, but GDI's new
      heavy-hitting units like the Mammoth Mark II and Ultima Mech
      prove too much for Obelisks to handle. Thus, the Mega Obelisk.
      It is much the same as the original, except it fires twice as
      many lasers for twice the devastation. VERY deadly.

       
  3.4 Features that were left out: The Nod Commando was removed because
      for some reason it kept causing problems with GDI also being
      able to build him, and the computer constantly saying "New
      Construction Options."
      The Stealth Banshee was removed because for some reason it wouldn't
      turn invisible.

  3.5 Features to Come: Getting the computer to use the new units with
      new task forces, possibly missions to go along with the mod if
      that ever proves possible.

4 HINTS 'N TIPS

     Wolf Mechs are more expensive than Titans, but they do damage
     MUCH more quickly. You'll have to decide whether you want quantity
     (Titans) or quality (Wolf mechs). The two designs work well
     together, so you can also mix 'n match.

     The Assault Tank is an effective basic unit, but a little too
     weak to be the mainstay of your attack force. Works best as a
     support unit.

     Orca Interceptors are almost identical performance-wise to Orca
     Fighters, they just have a different weapon. So it doesn't matter
     too much which you use, it's just a matter of whether you like
     missiles or lasers better.

     The Phalanx does twice the damage of a Hover MLRS, and doesn't
     cost a whole lot more... but that extra cost does count. The
     Phalanx's weak armor also means it's quite easy to lose a bundle
     of cash from a single obelisk shot. The extra damage can come
     in handy, though, so choose wisely whether you want to use this
     unit or not.

     Sonic Mechs do as much damage as Disruptors but are easier to
     kill. But, they're also faster and cheaper. Better for hit-and-run
     attacks than full-out assaults.

     The Ultima Mech is a very deadly weapon. Park it a long ways away
     from the enemy base and start leveling it. Its only weakness is that
     it can't fire at units close to it and it can't fire at air units,
     so give it some escort when it's going to destroy an enemy base.
     If you are Nod, Stealth Banshees are good for taking out these
     walking death machines.

     The new defenses are more effective than regular GDI defenses,
     but more costly. If your enemy uses hordes of weak units, stick
     with the old defenses and build a lot of them. But if youre enemy
     builds a few powerful units, build a handful of the new defensive
     structures and they'll take care of things.

     If you're Nod, you have  more stealth units to use with this
     mod. Stealth infantry and stealth cycles... they're
     all invisible, but they're all much more expensive than the basic
     units. Since the enemy base is likely to have a sensor array,
     it's best not to try an assault with these expensive, weakly-
     armored units. Instead, find a place where the enemy has no
     sensor array--like around his harvesters or with an attack force
     moving toward your base--and attack there with these units.

     The Flame Cycle and Flame Harpy are great for taking out enemy
     infantry, but not so with armor. Use them accordingly.

     The Mega Obelisk is capable of massive devastation. A few of
     these around your base, backed up perhaps by a few regular Obelisks
     or Laser Turrets, will keep you safe from anything but a horde
     of Ultima Mechs (which have superior range to obelisks).

5 HOW TO INSTALL

     Unzip the file wolfpack.zip into your Tiberian Sun directory
     (by default, C:\Westwood\Sun) with Winzip or a similar program
     to play. To uninstall, remove Rules.ini from your Tiberian Sun
     directory.
