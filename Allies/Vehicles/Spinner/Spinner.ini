Prerequisite: NEXUS War Factory
Cost: 500
Classification: Anti-Infantry Weapon
This innocuous spinning object seems harmless enough at first, hovering a few feet above the ground. However, those rotors have an edge just a few molecules thick, more than enough to sever heads from torsos with pinpoint precision and incredible speed.

Possibly call it Spinner, Spinning Blade, Shredder, Floater, Floating Blade, Disk, Spinning Disk, Floating Disk...

;Do I have a gattling gun or not
IsGattling=yes

;How weapons does it have? Currently, all Gattling Units have had anti-air
;capability, so the mechanics currently depends on having twice the number
;of stages in weapons, alternating anti-ground first, and anti-air second.

;How many stages does this gattling gun have, and how long does it
;take to progress through these stages;
WeaponStages=3
Stage1=100
Stage2=200
;This last stage is used to determine what the maximum fireing timer can be. Once it
;hits this it will stop increasing. If this is larger than the previous stage, then
;it will have a grace period once the unit stops firing before it needs to drop
;down to the lower weapon.
Stage3=1000

;EliteStage1=100
;EliteStage2=200
;EliteStage3=300

;How many increments or decrements does the timer get per frame?
;If RateDown is zero, then it overrides the previous stage vaules,
;causing the tank to instantly go to zero when it stops firing
;if it can't find a new target
