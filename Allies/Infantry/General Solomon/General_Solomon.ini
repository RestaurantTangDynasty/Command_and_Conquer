Solomon
Class: 		General

Nationality: 	American / Israeli
Specialization: 	Resource

Solomon is a General that is both a member of the leading American oligarchs and, indicated by subtle hints at that organization's existance, a member of a secretive zionist cabal (which we later learn to be the Zion Cooperative / Zion Corp.). His "special trait" in battle is that he can use the resource gathering system of the Islamic Foundation and the units of the United states / American Empire.
