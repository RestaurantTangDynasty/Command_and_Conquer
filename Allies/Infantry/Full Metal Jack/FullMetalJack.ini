Sergeant Jack F. Metal
„Full Metal Jacket“ was a heroic infantry scheduled to appear on the American side. A combat android developed by an American research project, he was geared towards a brute force style of fighting, variously functioning like a Brute or similar to Volkov of Red Alert, toting an oversized gun with him, and being capable of tanking huge (for an infantry) amounts of damage, complementing Jake McNeil as the infiltrative hero. 

Notes
    • Probably inspired by Jack of Tekken and Sergeant Metallitron, himself a Teminator expy, and C16 of Dragon Ball.
