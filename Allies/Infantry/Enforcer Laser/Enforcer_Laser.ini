; Also known as Prism Trooper, human gunners carrying laser guns and energy cells, both of which they drop and the latter of which can be stolen from them. 
; Like Suppressors, Enforcers wear body armor, in their case consisting of an armored hazmat suit, the helmet incorporating a radio and a gas mask or rebreather. 
; Their armor makes them immune to Slime, reduces lava damage (30) to 4-12. 
; Grants immunity to suffocation. 
; Presumably makes immune to gas. 
; '21/9/27 - Reflective armor plates are scrapped. Enforcers are no longer immune to laser weapons, just as the Shock Trooper/Tesla Vanguard is immune to electrical weapons.

'''Enforcers''', also known colloquially as '''Prism Troopers''', are [[Commonwealth]] heavy infantry, more powerful than [[Suppressor]]s, with a more futuristic theme. Enforcers are pretty effective against structures and soft targets,
 but useless against vehicles. When combined with missile-armed enemies, they are a force to be reckoned with. They can also be considered Commonwealth early siege units. Because of their armored suits, Enforcers cannot be attacked by [[dogs]]. When killed, five energy cells can be retrieved from their backpacks. 

Unlike the [Regulator] and the [[Suppressor]], whose armament varies (a [[pistol]] or [[MP5]] for Regulators and a [[MP5]] or for Suppressors, respectively), all Enforcers have identical armament, consisting of a [[laser gun]], although Enforcers are encountered at two different levels, with the higher-level version shooting blue laser beams, whereas the lower-level version shoots red laser beams. Enforcers wear a battery backpack containing [[energy cell]]s, which powers their weapon. 
Enforcers will shout “Stop!”, “You there!” and “Freeze!” at the start of battle, similar to the other tiers of human (and some non-human) units employed by the Basicorporation. Corrupted Enforcers retain no other faculty of speech than these.

====Notes====
* '''Cool Beam''' - Upon promotion, the Enforcer gains a blue laser instead of the previous red beam. This laser is a straight-up damage increase over the rookie laser and does not grant any special features. It also has a greater range and higher rate of fire. 

==Notes==
* Unlike the lower-tier Guards, the Enforcers do not have access to a secondary grenade attack, despite being anti-tank infantry - this is because they don't need it; the main attack's laser beam does damage that is unmodulated by the target's armor type (except for some specialized armor), meaning they are as effective against tanks, and even buildings, as they are against infantry, even in absence of a dedicated anti-material attack. However, the laser rifle does inflict less damage than a grenade, and has a point effect, rather than splash damage. This is however compensated for by its high rate of fire and higher accuracy.
** On the other hand, it also lacks the ability to fire behind obstacles as the grenade can.
* Their unique armor makes Enforcers immune to poison in gas form - they are not cyborgs, however, and their armor can be pierced by projectiles, meaning point-effect poison still takes effect against them.
* Enforcers also appear in several modifications for [[wikipedia:Red Alert 2|''Red Alert 2'']] by the same author, into which they were basically copied from an early version of the [[wikipedia:Mental Omega|''Mental Omega'']] modification. Enforcers in ''Mental Omega'' were laser-armed Allied infantrymen matching the Soviet tesla troopers. The concept of a laser-armed infantryman called &quot;Enforcer&quot; aligns with the Enforcer enemy appearing in the game [[wikipedia:Quake (video game)|''Quake'']]. In ''Quake'', the Enforcer is the second-tier human enemy after the Grunt, whereas in ''Quake II'', a wholly different entity going by the name of &quot;Enforcer&quot; - a cyborg with a machine gun for an arm, resembling the Cyborg Infantry appearing in [[wikipedia:Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun|''Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun'']] and other games set in the same world and around the same time and identified by the name &quot;Templar&quot; in [[wikipedia: Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade|''Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade'']] - appears, as a second tier to a group of enemy types that are called &quot;Guard&quot;. 
* Enforcers have a heavy breathing sound through their masks, resembling that of [[wikipedia:Darth Vader|Darth Vader]].
