Guards, 'city guards', 'peace guards', 'peacekeepers' or 'guards', . The policeman appears as a uniformed infantryman, armed with a semi-automatic pistol and is referred to as "Watchman". The 'riot police' variant is the [[Guard]], trainable by the [[Allies]]. 




The [[Allies|allied]] ''Guard'' infantry is somewhat of a riot police with heavy equipment, intended to quell domestic riots and keep people under control in the 'EUSSR'. The 'modern'-era Guards are a 21st-century replacement of the [[Rifleman]], which dominated the battlefields of the big wars of the 20th century. At the dawn of the 21st century, the era of large, expendable infantry drew to a close - in the western nations, conscription was abandoned and infantry split up into police-like guards and special forces, often mercenaries, both far less numerous than their 20th century predecessors.

* Unlike the riot police [[Guard]]s, the Watchman does not have access to the [[Tear Gas]] skill. 
* Can use Handcuff to arrest an opponent. 
===Random Kingdom II===
'''Policemen''' are encountered during the HOUSE civil war in Liamb House, being part of the security forces of the organization. The stronger version is the [[Guardsman]].

===Random Kingdom III===
'''Policemen''' are an infantry unit of the alpine ''[[New German Republic]]''. Curiously, their attire is not at all german - they appear to wear bobby hats and black trenchcoats.

===Random Kingdom VX===

===Red Alert 2: New World Order===
'''Policemen''' are neutral infantry that can be trained by a player owning a [[Police Station]]. In skirmish matches, these can be found placed on maps and must be captured by a player in order to be owned. In some missions, Police Stations might also be owned, or capturable, by one or more sides. Besides the Policeman, owning a Police Station also makes the police vehicles, [[Police Car]] and [[Police Van]], buildable. When readily trained, the Policeman will exit from the Police Station, rather than the owning player's Barracks. 

==Notes==
* The term '''Police''' and '''Gendarme''' are generally discouraged in official publications. Use the more medieval, but accurate, '''Guard'''.

===Red Alert 2: New World Order===
[[File:Guard_icon.png|right]]
'''Guards''' are the basic allied infantry, deployed by the [[Asian Alliance]] and [[European Union]]. They are armed with [[Minigun]]s and can be trained for 120$ when possessing [[Allies|Allied]] [[Barracks]]. The [[America]]ns deploy [[G.I.]]s instead.

Unlike their American and Soviet counterparts, Guards are not themed as military infantry (although in acctual battle, this does not matter at all), but rather as a sort of paramilitary or riot police, with the equipment and training necessary to protect allied installations, quell riots and carry out urban warfare. Unlike the Peacekeeper from ''Red Alert 3'', with which they shares this theme, they do not use shotguns, neither the lasers of the ''Sentinel'' and ''Guardian'' from ''Empire Earth'' (laser weaponry being delegated to the [[Enforcer]]). Instead they use what appears to be a submachine gun on screen, but has the ID <tt>[[Minigun]]</tt> in the code. This weapon, like all of their stats, are a relic of having been cloned off the Light Infantry of ''Tiberian Sun''.
[[Red Guard]] and [[Black Guard]] make appearances as [[Soviet]] elite military formations. 

====Notes====
* Other factions can train Guards by capturing a neutral [[Guard Station]], which will make them available as the next-higher tier from [[Regulator]]s, which are regular policemen. For non-European players, Regulators and Guards will both emerge from the Guard Station.

'''Schrödinger'''

====Skills====
* '''Half-life''' - If Schrödinger is killed in battle, he will not be dead - at least not entirely. Instead, you will find him next to your base, in an apparently unharmed, but amnesiac condition.
