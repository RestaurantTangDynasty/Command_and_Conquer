
; A more elite GI, but still only a GI. Not like its British brother, the Commando
; Let's just call it 'GI +3' internally, just like the elite Black Guard is a Conscript +3...
;  vc: Can't be GI+3! Has three upgrade stages itself! (Capture Buildings, Flash Grenades, Timed Charges)
;   Yeah, but Building Capture is upgrade for both Ranger and GI, so SetUpg would still work (like for Tiger and its Polaron Shell)...
