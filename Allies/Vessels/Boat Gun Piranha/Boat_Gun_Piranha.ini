;Do I have a gattling gun or not
IsGattling=yes

;How weapons does it have? Currently, all Gattling Units have had anti-air
;capability, so the mechanics currently depends on having twice the number
;of stages in weapons, alternating anti-ground first, and anti-air second.

;This last stage is used to determine what the maximum fireing timer can be. Once it

;How many increments or decrements does the timer get per frame?
