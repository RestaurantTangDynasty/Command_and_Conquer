Alliance
The Alliance relies less on sophisticated reconaissance and their units pack much more firepower than those of the Union, being matched perhaps only by Russia.

Units: GI, Bazooka, Officer, M103, B-52, F-117 NightHawk, F-22 Raptor, A-10 Warthog


Alliance Airforce
The Alliance relies much more on a strategic airfleet than the Union, since it requires its payloads to be shipped across the globe. Therefore, allied bombers carry much larger payloads of much more devastating bombs. The Allies also have a larger array of different, mission-specific aircraft to choose from. The B-1, B-52 and B-2 all serve strategic bombardment, while F-117, F-17, Warthog and F-22 are all thought for more tactical air-to-ground attacks. The F-22 is a next-generation experimental fighter and unique to the USAF. All are, however, poorly defended to more sophisticated fighter technology, however less to anti-aircraft fire.
