VeteranAbilities=CLOAK	;<- !!! we now give Cloakable as Veteran ability - because the F-117 will obtain Cloaking when Vet, but still have its old weapon, it will uncloak to fire when vet. But when Elite, the cloaking "becomes more powerful" - the Elite weapon will not uncloak the plane, so in a sense Elite further upgrades the plane! !!!
