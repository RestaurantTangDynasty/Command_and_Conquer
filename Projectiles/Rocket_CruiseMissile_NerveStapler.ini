Mechanics 
The EMNS-34 is used to carry a NSFB-40a (Nerve stapling, fly-by v.40a) lateral warhead which emits the necessary electromagnetic waves in order to create neurological overload. It flies at lower altitudes in order to affect enemy personnel and cause paralysis, a comatose state, or even death. 
As of yet, not much information has been released on the EMNS-34.
