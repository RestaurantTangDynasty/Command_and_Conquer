;----- Base Attributes -----
BehavesLike			= Gas		; Presumably, only the BehavesLike of the ParticleSystem matters when this is spawned by one. Was "Fire".

;----- Movement -----
Deacc				= 0.01

;Cluster			= 3		; Ditto. (From InvisibleA_LaoTze.) <= We do not use this. Instead, use the damage/warhead to tweak the rate and number of clouds spawned at the point of impact (since different weapons should spawn them at a different rate, and we don't want to create a different projectile for each of them).
