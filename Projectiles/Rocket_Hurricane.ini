; Rocket ballistic inaccurate
; This is used by the Grad, Hind, Katyusha, Venom Wasp Elite+. 
; A rocket "as simple as it gets" (ID: Rocket) with just an image also existed, but was deleted, as nothing uses it. 
; A non-inaccurate ballistic rocket also "as simple as it gets" (ID: BRocketLow) also existed, but was deleted, as nothing uses it.  
; A doublet non-inaccurate ballistic medium-level rocket (ID: BRocket and RocketProj) and high-altitude rocket (ID: BRocketHigh) also existed, but were deleted. 
; An unspecified header "Rocket.Arc" (Arcing Rocket) also existed, presumably intended to be stipulated into BRocket, or BRocketLow.
