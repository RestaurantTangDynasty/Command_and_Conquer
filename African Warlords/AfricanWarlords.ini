; This is a difficult one. As we've discussed before, several African _countries_ are Soviet-aligned. 
; (Some might be UN-aligned, but those are not actual subfactions, and will appear in campaign only, using other country data.) 
; However, Africans in general are TechGroup "Forgotten", and their territories should not be concrete countries. 
; I think the synthesis could be that Soviet-aligned African Warlords use the TechGroup Forgotten, 
; with some Soviet hardware added.
