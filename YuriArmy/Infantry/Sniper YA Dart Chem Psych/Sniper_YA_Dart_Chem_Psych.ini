; - Tranq Dart: The target will be tranquilized, unable to move, fire or cover. 
; - Panic Dart: The target will become panicked, running around wildly, unable to fire or be given orders. 
; - Rage Dart: The target will become overwhelmed with rage and confusion, firing blindly at friends and foes alike. 
; - Stult Dart: The target falls under the control of the player controlling Mania. 
; Upgrading beyond these will lead to the mutator darts (Garg), and thereby to unification with Toxophilia.
