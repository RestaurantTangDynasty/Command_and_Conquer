; This might seem useless, being a weaker version of mind-control that would be suited rather for Eurasia (Black Guard subfaction) than Yuri's Army. 
; However, it is a leg up, as it converts temp-controlled enemies into perma-controlled. 
; One of the Yuri subfactions does not get this, as they have a mobile abductor with perma-control ability. 
; And there's an upgrade to that in the form of a perma-control vehicle or even super-Yuri, sidestepping the need to abduct (which, let's face it, other than the below-health capacity, which perma-control does not have, adds nothing but UI redundancy.)
