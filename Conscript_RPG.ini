Cost=400;July 2011;475;<---=< Still didn't work. I *suspect* it is because SENGINEER is read first, for whatever reason, but not from the InfantryType list. New cost lowered to 475 and this finally gets the sorting right...;500;was 510. Why? Was there any reason for why this should be exactly 510? I lowered the cost just a bit, not as much as to affect gameplay, but to get some order into the sidebar cameo sorting. The RPG Trooper is now the same as Engineer (both 500$), and it goes first in the InfantryType list, so this will go first in the sidebar, just next to the Black Guard.
Soylent=235 ; Since 475 won't work with 50% refund, we'll say it that way - half of 470, as an even number.
