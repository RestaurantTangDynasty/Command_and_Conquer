Damage				= 1
Range				= 5			; 3 ; Adjusted range to bomb's range so we have an actual 'Napalm run', not just the same location attacked over and over again. ; 2.5

ROF				= 10			; Also, this is new, copied from bomb. Before, this tag was left out (maybe already missing in TD?), so game considered this 0; was 1
Warhead				= Napalm		; Fire	; No, it was a residual tag on the [Fire] warhead itself which called for the anim. This was residual from the time before we split them. ; this apparently gets ignored - instead, it uses the warhead of the cluster weapons, so we get the EXPINTIFRE anim right from the fire location
