; This is both the Civilian and Generic version. 
; That is tricky, should it be Civilian or Generic? Should only objects which are the generic, but not part of any faction, be in the Generic category? 
; This is at least how we would treat objects which are the generic, but owned by other factions: they are in their respective Side categories, not in Generic.
