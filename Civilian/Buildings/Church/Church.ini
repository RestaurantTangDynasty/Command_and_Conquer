Church
    • Replaces Soviet Palace. Fulfills same function. 
    • Is not a legal target. 
    • Has some SWs. I don't recall what abilities the Palace had. 
    • ;;;;;Has a healing aura (infantry). 
    • Suppresses certain (mystical?) SWs around itself. 
    • Required for recruitment of Black Guard. 
    • Has SW which has Confessors as designators and produces an area of effect around the target Confessor that boosts nearby units. Recharges super quickly but does not stack. 
        ◦ Hold it – SWs can auto-fire on multiple targets (which is one way to produce the aura effect of the Prop Tower). So, we could make this an invisible auto-firing SW which thereby produces permanent auras around all Confessors without needing a weapon slot AND functioning on-the-move! Voilá! 
            ▪ They would lose their aura if the Church is lost, but that is just all the more fitting.
