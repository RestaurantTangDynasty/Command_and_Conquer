;*** Latin Confederation ******************************************************
;******************************************************************************
; This is a faction and tech-group. It is instantiated by Brazil, Cuba, Mexico and Venezuela. 
; It is Soviet-aligned, and the tech-group is a mix of Soviet tech and its own thing. 
; Latin Confederation units are the Ocelot, Jaguar Tank, Colibri, Batarito, Cazador, Airboat. 
;
; Interestingly, apparently "technicals" (waggones gonne) themselves are not used Mexican drug war; 
; in fact, I was not able to find any mention of the use of such vehicles in Americolatin. 
; This may be because the tactical roles to be filled are different; there have not been open field battles 
; within the era in which these vehicles have proliferated. I'm sure that some insurgents of FARC or similar 
; groups have at times had a pickup truck with a person with a gun in the back. However, the conditions are 
; presumably not such as that it would make sense for such a type of vehicle to become an ubiquitous mainstay 
; of a combat force, in the same way as is seen in the MENA and Africa. 
; Americolatin has functioning governments, whereas in Africa, such groups are in many places the government. 
; Interestingly, up-armored trucks, called "Narco Tanks", are used by Mexican cartels. These come close to the 
; hillbilly armor seen especially on SVBIEDs, but also some other MENA improvised combat vehicles. 
; Although that armor is there not ubiquitous, perhaps owing to its lesser utility in the context of that battlefield, 
; but perhaps also owing to a greater availability of vehicles that do not correspond to the available amount of armoring 
; materials that could be (effectively) used here, or to the man-hours available to (effectively) process them. 
; (These are different concerns; it could be that the vehicles would be made more effective if armored, 
; but the same materials or man-hours are more efficiently spent somewhere else. 
; OTOH, it may also be that armoring these vehicles makes them _less_ effective, perhaps because of weight to speed concerns, 
; or cooling in a desert climate.)
; Plausibly, this is because they only have to withstand small arms fire in an urban context, where adding armor is helpful, 
; whereas no degree of available up-armoring would protect from heavy ordnance in military engagements. 
; (I.e. the problem that led to the demise of the Tank Heavy.)
; Some of the Narco Tanks (those classified as "light" on tank encyclopedia) are indeed just technicals, but with 
; great emphasis on armor protection, and smaller weaponry than that mounted on MENA vehicles. 
; Bigger ones are built on the basis of larger trucks. 
; "Narco tanks" could be put into the unit roster as well. Although MG, Flamer, Toxin, Rockets, Mortar appear possible, 
; these are not attested. Incorporating March of War, the MG and Toxin variants would be acceptable. 
;
; Also, various militaries do use pickup trucks (and that is far from ubiquitous; I think in Europe you would 
; not find it), e.g. the Mexican military. It just appears that they are not used by any insurgents, but they 
; are used by regular militaries. 
; Given that we have some actual state militaries under discussion here, it could be considered for inclusion. 
; 
; The Borillo resembles roughly a SU/ISU (although it has been rightly pointed out by "Graion Dilach", 
; who is, judging from his other locutions, otherwise a complete idiot, that inspiration was the 
; Vindicator of WH40k, though that in turn may have been inspired by the former.)
; If one insists, it could also be a StuG III, but I don't think so. 
; It could be that these are _looted_ SU/ISUs, and so could be in both the Forgotten and Latin Confederation tech groups, 
; but I think they look too different. 
; However, it would make sense to see them as a local development based upon the SU/ISU concept. 
; This would reasonably limit their proliferation to the Latin Confederation. 
;
; The most basic unit would be the Guerillero. 
; RPGs are a staple of revolutionary movements, so there would also be an RPG variant. 
;
; Further unit inspiration can be taken from March of War, although the Latin Junta is explicitly NOT Soviet-leaning. 
; (It's a weird mix.)
; Presumably, the Latin Confederation would need something to deal with the terrain, and vermin. 
; This could implicate flamethrowers and chem infantry. But I'm not too happy with the idea, it seems to 
; complicate a unification with the "natives". It seems that such weapons fit an invading force. 
; They could, however, use forest-derived toxins, rather than industrial ones. 
;
; Guerilla warfare in woodlands would also be a suitable terrain for a sniper. 
;
; Mortars (Bombardiers) would also fit guerilla warfare, but whether they are suitable for the terrain is debatable. 
; There are no particularly iconic precedents of their use (unlike, say, in the case of the IRA or Hamas), 
; but MoW features them. 
;
; Other, unspecified parts can be filled with the "Soviet lite" (or "Old Soviet") tech group, which in turn includes many generics. 
; This would be the Ore Truck, Outpost, Refinery, Barbed Wire, Sandbags, Barricade, maybe a wooden fence (living plants?), and 
; befitting poverty and insurgency, a junk wall perhaps. 
; Traps (mines and other types) would be fitting insurgency, but are not well attested. 
; Certain kinds of traps (using wild or poisonous animals, natural toxins, or simple spears or arrows) would possibly fit 
; the theme in other ways. 
; There could also be more unique wall structures, such as the Moat, Oil Moat, and Toxic Moat. 
; I think the Oil Moat would fit the MENA insurgents better, but, using natural toxins instead of artificial ones, I think the 
; toxic moat would be quite fitting. 
;
; Brazil's unique unit is the Borillo (and its variants). 
; Cuba's unique unit is one of the higher-level Mad Bombers. 
; Mexico's unique unit are the Jaguar Assault Infantry, and Jaguar Tank Hunter. 
; Venezuela's unique unit is the Smuggler. 
; Geographically, it is in Americolatin. 
; This is possibly the region with the most "players": 
; At least Argentina is in Americolatin, but not part of the Latin Confederation, 
; and its tech group is "Allies lite". 
; It is unclear what the relation is between Latin Confederation states, and 
; guerilla movements in Americolatin, as is the relation between these two, and the 
; widespread criminal networks of drug-producers in that region 
; (but here, RL provides examples). 
; Then there is also the aspect of Nazi remnants, and their interactions with the aforementioned. 
; If they exist at all in this timeline, in whatever fashion. 
; More long-term, the relation to the "ancient aliens" indigenes, and the GSE, 
; would also show up as a question.
