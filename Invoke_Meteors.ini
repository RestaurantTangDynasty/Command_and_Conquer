Headquarters
'''Headquarters'''
Headquarters and their associated infrastructure often comprise bases that take up large portions of a map. 


Ortillery
'''Ortillery''', a portmanteau of "Orbit" and "Artillery", refers to space-based weapons systems with the ability to attack targets on the planet surface. Ortillery is recurringly an asset of the [[Allies]], reinforced by its association with the GDI in the ''Tiberium'' universe, the Americans in ''Generals'' and, recently, the Athena Cannon in ''Red Alert 3'' (although the Spy Satellite was an Allied property even before that, making a satellite-based weapon a logical upgrade).
