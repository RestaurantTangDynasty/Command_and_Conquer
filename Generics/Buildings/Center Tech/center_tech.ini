;; ontologically incomplete, do not place. 
; It can be placed now, we completed it with OTLTECH and CASLAB. 
; Now it has several functions: 
; It grants 3 upgrade slots (like a regular CT). 
; It grants secret units. 
; It grants an SW which upgrades units to "Experimental" tag, giving them unusual abilities and statistics. 
; When destroyed, scientists emerge.
