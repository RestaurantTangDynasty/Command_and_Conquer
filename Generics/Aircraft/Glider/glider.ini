;*** Glider
;
; Infantry can arrive in this glider. 
; It's simple enough to be a generic, but is effectively only used by North Korea at this time. 
; It can also be granted as crate goodie, in which case it would allow an infantry unit to traverse a certain distance aerially 
; just once, as it expires when you land.
