;*** Cruiser ******************************************************************
;******************************************************************************
; Armed with two 8 inch cannons (engagement range 18). The projectiles are inaccurate. If friendly units are found in the prospective blast zone of the attack, the Cruiser will not fire its cannons at a target unless explicitely ordered to do so by its commander.
; Elite upgrade replaces main guns with railguns. 
; Elite upgrade grants Tomahawk Cruise Missile launcher; has a range slightly in excess of the 8 inch guns and is used to automatically engage targets within that range. When explicitly ordered to attack a target, the Cruiser will close into cannon range and use both the Tomahawk and cannons to engage that target.
; The Tomahawk is slightly homing (very slightly) and can be used to attack slow-moving targets, but its main role is to engage structures. It deals 600 [[blast]] damage. Unlike cannon shells, the missile can be shot down by air defense and CIWS.
; Engagement range: 25
; Cruisers were a part of the Allied navy during World War II in RA. They were armed with dual [[8 Inch gun]] turrets.
; These ships were phased out by ''Red Alert 2'''s [[World War III]] in favour of the [[Aircraft Carrier]]s as main source of naval long-range force projection. Cruisers are a recurring addition to the Allied arsenal in mods, such as being a generic allied naval unit in [[Red Alert 2: New World Order]].
