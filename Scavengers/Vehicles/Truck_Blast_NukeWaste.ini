; Radiological (dirty) bomb truck - Blast Truck with Nuke Waste upgrade. 
; This unit has reduced brt damage, but spreads radiation and deals improved damage to infantry. 
; This unit becomes available if player controls a Nuclear Power Plant (from another faction), a Nuclear Bunker, 
; or purchases the "Radiological Waste" upgrade from a Market. 
; Like all the blast trucks, it is eligible to be upgraded with the Scrap Armor upgrade. 
; Because VeteranAbilities and EliteAbilities do not apply to DeathWeapons, this unit needs to have a type transition at Veteran and Elite. 
; This also allows us to be more creative with what the promoted versions and their weapons can do. 
; Promoted RadioBlast Truck should have increased spread of radiation & more intense radiation when exploding (which is impossible with VA/EA). 
; They also move faster (which is regularly possible with VA/EA).

; RA2's DTRUCK (Lybian Demolition Truck)
; This is RA2's Demo Truck. Parts of it were relegated to the base Blast Truck, so it's also possible to consider that unit as the (severely altered) Demolition Truck.
