Bomb Ship
A more powerful version of the Fire Ship. It has two health bars - one normal HP bar, and one fuse bar. The fuse has less HP but can only be reduced by damage of [Fire] type. If that happens, the entire ship will explode violenty, doing massive damage nearby. When burning, the ship will cause damage to adjacent fields, like a Fire Ship.
