; There used to be two weapons: "ScudDummy" and "ScudCollision"/"ScudExplosion". 
; ScudDummy had a range (5) which determined the Scud's CEP. 
; ScudCollision/ScudExplosion was the weapon used when the Scud actually impacted. 
; There is also "ScudLauncher", which is the weapon used to launch the Scud from 
; the "Luna" launcher.
