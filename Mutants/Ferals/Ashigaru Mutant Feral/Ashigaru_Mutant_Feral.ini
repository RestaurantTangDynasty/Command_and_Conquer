      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1031">Found on the [[Isla de los Muertos]] map, these zombies are transformed [[Japan]]ese personnel left on the islands since the Great Pacific War in the 1940's through 60's. They wear outdated and often torn uniforms and are often largely decomposed to almost skeletal state. Many are dormant or barely mobile, but will attack the player if he or she approaches their &quot;corpses&quot;. They are mostly found in the underground/bunker portion of the map. As they are often located between other &quot;true&quot; skeletons, they are hard to spot and the player should be weary of approaching corpses to loot in the underground rooms and corridors. When killed, Infected Ashigaru carry an old rifle, a tattered uniform, a rusty knife, some ammunition and some money. Most of their baggage is worthless and it is hard to kill them in a way that makes it possible to retrieve these items. 

==Equipment==
* Tattered Imperial Uniform
* Tattered Straw Hat
* Puttee
* Boots
* Bolt-action rifle
* Rusty knife
* Yen
* Bullets
* Decomposed rations
* Water bottle
