;******************************************************************************
; Infected type - differentiate from brainscorched and necromantic. 
; Just like the Brainscorched, these are not literally 'dead', they are infected with a mutating agent that has affected their physiology and is controlling their actions or has reduced/altered their mind. 
; Because of their altered physiology, it does not matter that they are not actually undead - they gain numerous of the immunities and altered reactions of 'true' necromantic undead. 
; This is the base type. 
; There are other Ferals, but they have more advanced mutations. 
; E.g. the Brute version, and more complex and fantastic ones.
