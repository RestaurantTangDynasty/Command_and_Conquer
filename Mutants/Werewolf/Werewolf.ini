
The Third Power's unit spectrum is characterized by units with excellent statistics, but a high degree of specialization compared to the other side's units (such as their anti-tank infantry being useful against tanks exclusively, compared to the allied additional anti-air capability and the soviet siege capability). With the exception of select high-tech units, their unit selection seems to have halted on the level of ''Red Alert'' and their industrial output can't compare with either of the other sides, both of which they make up for by great upgradeability of their units. Like the other sides, several unique technologies are part of the Third Power's portfolio: sonic weaponry, chemical weapons, mind control, mutation and certain kinds of directed energy weapons (''Kraftstrahlkanone'') seem to be used exclusively by them. Even more obscurely (the aforementioned being somewhat acceptable within the widely imaginative military technology that appears in the ''Command & Conquer'' series), the faction also has access to [[Magic|magical]] appliances, in the form of [[Freikugel|tracking bullets]] used by their hero sniper infantry, [[Major Erwin KÃ¶nig]]. Explaining the presence of these powers in the hands of a not-very-mysterious conservative-militaristic alternate European Union becomes somewhat hard after the retcon that took the Nazi aspect out of the Third Power's backstory, as the Third Reich is often associated with the supernatural in fiction. However, secret societies associated with the Nazis (such as the [[wikipedia:Vril Society|Vril Society]]) and often depicted to be the source of the Reich's supernatural powers in fiction, would survive the Nazi party's collapse and the technology may have been transmitted by them to the governments.

Many of the units of the Third Power shun higher technology and mutual aid in favour of individual strength, but in terms of stats, their engineering is marvellous. If there ''is'' a significant technological component, it is most often steampunk, dieselpunk or magitek (see raygun gothic).

; The result of dark magic or elaborate research into the mysteries of life and evolution, the '''Werewolf''' is a humanoid wolf, walking on hind legs and standing up to a size of 3m. These beasts lead Third Power infantry charges and attack at close range with their powerful claws and fangs, mauling infantry and even light vehicles alike. They possess no form of ranged weaponry and can therefore easily be picked off by concentrated gunfire, however their powerful legs and great endurance allows them to rapidly close the distance to any unprotected defender.
