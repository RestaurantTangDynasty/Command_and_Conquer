; Keep VeteranCap at 2, there are some types that we don't want to convert at Veteran, as VeteranAbilities can handle just fine whatever should change about them at that level. 
; In addition, Promote.VeteranType is to be used in other situations.

; veteran factors
; gs: checked up on these since Armor was broken. Now they are all multipliers. 
; vc: Except for VeteranRatio, these are not really used anymore, as we can use Type Conversion instead. These are the defaults. 
[General]
VeteranRatio			= 3.0			; must destroy this multiple of self-value to become a veteran [per level]
VeteranCombat			= 1.3			; multiplier to damage
VeteranSpeed			= 1.3			; multiplier to max speed
VeteranSight			= 2.0			; multiplier to sight !!!going past 10 is a hard code Vegas crash!!!
VeteranArmor			= 1.3			; For armor, think of it as max strength being multiplied by the number (in reality, damage is divided by this
VeteranROF			= 0.5			; ROF delay multiplier
VeteranCap			= 2			; maximum veteran level that can be obtained
InitialVeteran			= no			; Do initial forces start as veterans?
