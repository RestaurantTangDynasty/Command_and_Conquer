; Keep VeteranCap at 2, there are some types that we don't want to convert at Veteran, 
; as VeteranAbilities can handle just fine whatever should change about them at that level. 
; In addition, Promote.VeteranType is to be used in other situations. 

;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; veteran factors
; gs: checked up on these since Armor was broken. Now they are all multipliers. 
; vc: Except for VeteranRatio, these are not really used anymore, as we can use Type Conversion instead. These are the defaults.
