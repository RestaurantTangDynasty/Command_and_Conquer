The '''Civilian Defense Force''' is a faction representing the community self-protection effort.

=Neutral Forces=
Difficult to differentiate from CDF.

Neutral forces should have a very basic unit roster that covers all the areas of the old RA Allies & Soviets, ie anti-infantry, tank-to-tank, artillery, transportation. We can skip both the resource unit (as it can be rolled into transport) and we ''should'' skip the light tank, because it does not have a real function vis-a-vis anti-infantry recon units. The function in RA was kind of dubious because the light tank was a fast raider, but with anti-tank capabilities, the latter of which was already covered by the medium. Oh, and also add an anti-air vehicle (which RA didn't have), a support vehicle (builder, repairer, maybe both) and maybe a rudimentary aircraft. Should be totally generic armed forces without particular technologies.
